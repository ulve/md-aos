# Chalice of Ushoran

_Believed to be a manifestation of the sacred cup held by Ushoran, this bone-wrought goblet is continually filled with the blood of those slain in its presence. When the gore inside overflows, the Flesh-eaters upon whom it slops are bestowed with unnatural vitality, their most grievous wounds healing and their dead rising to fight once more._
