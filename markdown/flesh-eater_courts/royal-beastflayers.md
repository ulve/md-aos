# Royal Beastflayers

_Led by vampiric Flaymasters, the Royal Beastflayers are obsessed with hunting those monsters that lurk across the realms. It matters not if their prey are genuine abominations or noble beasts – all make for a fine banquet indeed._

## Hunter’s Instincts

_Royal Beastflayers believe themselves to be the finest monster-slayers in all the land. Certainly, they possess a knack for hindering and ensnaring their prey before moving in to make the kill._

Enemy MONSTERS within 3" of this unit cannot carry out monstrous rampages. In addition, reduce the Damage characteristic of weapons used by enemy MONSTERS by 1 while they are within 3" of any friendly units with this ability, to a minimum of 1.

## Offal Hounds

_Offal Hounds have a keen sense of smell and help guide the Beastflayers to vulnerable prey._

While this unit includes any Offal Hounds, add 2" to the Move characteristic of this unit if it is within 18" of any enemy MONSTERS that have any wounds allocated to them.
