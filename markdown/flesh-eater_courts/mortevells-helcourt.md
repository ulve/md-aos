# Mortevell’s Helcourt

_Amongst the deluded cannibals of the Ymetrican Flesh-eaters, there are none more devoted to Nagash than Gorstane Mortevell. With screeching, howling invective, the ghoulish emperor drives his ‘court’ into a frenzy of religious devotion. To their victims, it is nothing more than a rabid display of madness._
