# Crypt Ghouls

_Filled with a dark hunger, Crypt Ghouls pounce upon their prey. They are ferocious in great numbers, as each mordant competes with its kin for food. Should a ghoul catch a glimpse of their king, they will fight all the harder, eager to prove their worth._

_Each model in a Crypt Ghouls unit is armed with Sharpened Teeth and Filthy Claws._

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be a Crypt Ghast. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s Sharpened Teeth and Filthy Claws.

## Boundless Ferocity

_When Crypt Ghouls gather in large numbers their ferocity knows no bounds._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made by this unit is 6, that attack automatically wounds the target (do not make a wound roll). If this unit has 20 or more models, unmodified hit rolls of 5 or 6 automatically wound the target.

## Royal Approval

_Crypt Ghouls will always do their utmost to attract the attention of their sovereign._

Improve the Rend characteristic of this unit’s melee weapons by 1 while it is wholly within 9" of any friendly COURTIERS or 18" of any friendly ABHORRANTS.
