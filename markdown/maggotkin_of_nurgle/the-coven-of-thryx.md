# The Coven of Thryx

_None can say where Magister Thryx first learned to take the essence of destroyed daemons and use it to power living spells. He weaves an unpredictable path across the realms, forever seeking to elude Tzeentchâ€™s gaze. He offers his expertise to any patron who will shelter him and facilitate his lunatic experiments._
