# Rotmire Creed

_The Rotmire Creed are artisans of virology, relentless in their pursuit of the perfect plague. Their blowpipe darts and melee weapons are daubed with their alchemical contagions, which, once unleashed, spread quickly through the ranks of their enemies._

_Each model in a Rotmire Creed unit is armed with a Blowpipe and Bilewood Weapons._

## Witherlord

WITHERLORD: 1 in every 10 models in this unit must be a Witherlord. That model has a Wounds characteristic of 2. In addition, Witherlords can issue commands to their own unit.

## Virulent Concoctions

_The hideous diseases formulated by the Rotmire Creed rapidly transmit from one uninfected body to another._

If this unit is included in a Maggotkin of Nurgle army, at the end of any phase in which attacks made by this unit inflicted 1 or more disease points on an enemy unit, each other enemy unit within 3" of that enemy unit is also given 1 disease point. The same unit cannot be affected by this ability more than once per phase.
