# Hargax’s Pit-beasts

_Hargax once ruled the gladiatorial Pit of Shattered Spines with a fist of iron. Even when overthrown by a younger rival, the ogroid was not slain. Determined to reclaim his throne, Hargax – now older and wiser – seeks a means of evening the odds. He roams the lands searching for monsters to break into submission._
