# Rotigus

_Brandishing his mouldy gnarlrod at the skies, Rotigus Rainfather calls down the inundating Deluge of Nurgle, even as the fanged maws that split his flesh vomit streams of diseased bile, drowning the enemy in torrents of noxious filth._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Plague Legion Overlord • Rancid Retinue

## Warmaster

WARMASTER: If this unit is included in a Maggotkin of Nurgle army, it is treated as a general even if it is not the model picked to be the army’s general.

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 2 spells in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 2 spells in the enemy hero phase.

## Bloated With Corruption

_A Great Unclean One’s immense body is swollen with putrid secretions. Should the daemon be wounded deeply, the noxious effluvia jet forth to shower the attacker._

Bloated with Corruption: If an unmodified ward roll for this unit is 6, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this unit. That enemy unit suffers disease point.

## Deluge Of Nurgle

_Rotigus has an affinity with the plagued downpours that spill from Nurgle’s cauldron, and he is able to influence where the blighted rains fall._

The Rainfather: You can re-roll the casting roll when this unit attempts to cast the Deluge of Nurgle spell.

## Mountain Of Loathsome Flesh

_Great Unclean Ones are massively corpulent abominations; when they go on the rampage, enemies caught in their path are often swallowed up and crushed between great rolls of rancid blubber._

Mountain of Loathsome Flesh: You can carry out this monstrous rampage with this unit instead of any other monstrous rampage you can earn out with this unit. If you do so, pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this unit and roll a dice. On a 2+, that enemy unit suffers a number of mortal wounds equal to the Mountain of Loathsome Flesh value on this unit’s damage table.

## Deluge Of Nurgle

_The wizard hums a phlegmy dirge, calling forth a gelid downpour of corrosive rainwater._

Deluge of Nurgle: Deluge of Nurgle is a spell that has a casting value of 7. If successfully cast, roll 7 dice. For each 5+, you can pick 1 different enemy unit that is visible to the caster. Each of those units suffers D3 mortal wounds.
