BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Contagium Overlord

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 1 spell in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 1 spell in the enemy hero phase.

## Tainted Endless Spell

_Rotbringer Sorcerers hold that there is nothing they cannot corrupt, and many prove this point by tainting the autonomous spells that roam the lands._

If this unit summons an endless spell, then for the purposes of the Diseased battle trait, that endless spell is treated as a unit with the MAGGOTKIN OF NURGLE keyword that is in the same army as this unit.

## Stream Of Corruption

_Uttering glottal curses, the Sorcerer unleashes a torrent of bile and brackish filth upon their enemies._

Stream of Corruption: Stream of Corruption is a spell with a casting value of 6 and a range of 7". If successfully cast, pick 1 enemy unit within range and visible to the caster. Roll 1 dice for each model in that unit that is within range of the caster. For each 5+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound.Before attempting to cast this spell, you can say that the caster will project the stream across a greater distance. If you do so, the spell has a range of 14" but only inflicts 1 mortal wound for each roll of 6 instead of each roll of 5+.
