# The Wurmspat

_The Blightkings Sepsimus and Ghulgoch have sworn themselves to the service of Fecula Flyblown. They form a shield of flabby putrescence and rusted weapons between the Sorcerer and any who may threaten her._

_The models in the Wurmspat are Sepsimus Plaguesworn and Ghulgoch the Butcher. Each is armed with a Blighted Weapon._

## Festering Bodyguards

_Fecula journeyed to Beastgrave with her two favoured bodyguards, who protect her from any who would see her work for the Grandfather undone._

If a friendly FECULA FLYBLOWN is within 3" of this unit, before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to her, or instead of making a ward roll for her, you can roll a dice. On a 4+, that wound is allocated to this unit instead and cannot be negated.

## Relentless Attackers

_Blightkings grind through the battlelines of lesser foes, shattering their morale and hacking down the stunned survivors with contemptuous ease._

At the end of the combat phase, pick 1 enemy unit with a Wounds characteristic of 3 or less that is within 3" of this unit. Roll 1 dice for each model in this unit that is within 3" of that enemy unit. For each roll that exceeds that enemy unitâ€™s Wounds characteristic, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.
