# Beasts of Nurgle

_As stupid as they are enthusiastic, Beasts of Nurgle bound forth with burbles of joy. Huge, slug-like abominations, they gleefully assail their luckless playmates until their joy proves lethal, before bounding off after new victims._

## Attention Seekers

_Beasts of Nurgle seek out playmates with an enthusiasm that is rarely reciprocated by the horrified ob jects of their desire._

This unit can run or retreat and still charge later in the same turn. In addition, when this unit retreats, it can pass across other models in the same manner as a model that can fly.

## Diseased Slime Trails

_Diseased goo seeps from the skin of these disgusting creatures._

Before this unit retreats, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 3" of this unit. On a 4+, that unit suffers 1 disease point.

## Pestilent Battering Rams

_Beasts of Nurgle smash into enemy battlelines, crushing the foe and unleashing myriad plagues as they flail around with joy._

After a model in this unit finishes a charge move, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 1" of that model. On a 2+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. If this unit has more than 1 model, roll to determine if mortal wounds are caused after each model finishes its charge move, but do not allocate the mortal wounds until all of the models in the unit have finished their charge moves.
