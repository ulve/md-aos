# Pusgoyle Blightlords (Single)

_Elite Rotbringers mounted atop Rot Flies, Pusgoyle Blightlords thrum ahead of their kindred to sow panic and death. Their crushing tocsins and whistling scythes make short work of any who would slow the spread of decay._

## Wrack And Ruin

_Mortal Maggotkin who ride Rot Flies act as brutal linebreakers, using their sheer bulk to smash enemy formations asunder._

Wrack and Ruin: After a model in this unit finishes a charge move, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 1" of that model. Add 2 to the roll if the model is armed with a Dolorous Tocsin. On a 4+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.If this unit has more than 1 model, roll to determine if mortal wounds are inflicted after each model finishes its charge move, but do not allocate the mortal wounds until all of the models in the unit have finished their charge moves.

## Relentless Attackers

_Like their Blightking brethren, Pusgoyle Blightlords grind through the ranks of lesser foes, relying on their unnatural resilience and bloated mass to relentlessly press onwards through melees._

At the end of the combat phase, pick 1 enemy unit with a Wounds characteristic of 3 or less that is within 3" of this unit. Roll 1 dice for each model in this unit that is within 3" of that enemy unit. For each roll that exceeds that enemy unit’s Wounds characteristic, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.
