## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Contagium Overlord

## Warmaster

WARMASTER: If this unit is included in a Maggotkin of Nurgle army, it is treated as a general even if it is not the model picked to be the army’s general.

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 2 spells in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 2 spells in the enemy hero phase.

## Blightkrieg

_At a signal from his brothers, the usually ponderous Ghurk launches into an earth-shaking countercharge. Nearby Maggotkin are quick to take advantage of the enemy's shock at the abomination's sudden turn of speed._

You can use this command ability at the end of the enemy movement phase if this unit is within 12" of an enemy unit. The command must be issued by this unit and must be received by another friendly MAGGOTKIN OF NURGLE unit that is within 12" of an enemy unit. This unit and then the unit that received the command can attempt a charge.

## Horrific Opponent

_So terrifying are the Glottkin that many enemies simply break and run rather than fight them. Should there be no avenue of retreat, the crushing press offleeing warriors can prove just as lethal as facing the brothers themselves._

At the start of the enemy movement phase, you must roll 2D6 for each enemy unit that is within 3" of this unit. If the roll is equal to or greater than that unit’s Bravery characteristic, that unit must retreat in that phase or, if it is unable to retreat, it suffers D6 mortal wounds instead.

## Mountain Of Loathsome Flesh

_Once he has built up momentum, Ghurk Glott is almost unstoppable - even the proudest battleline cannot hope to withstand him._

Mountain of Loathsome Flesh: You can carry out this monstrous rampage with this unit instead of any other monstrous rampage you can carry out with this unit. If you do so, pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this unit and roll a dice. On a 2+, that enemy unit suffers a number of mortal wounds equal to the Mountain of Loathsome Flesh value on this unit’s damage table.

## Abundance Of Flesh

_Ethrac Glott generously bestows a growth spurt of the most repulsive kind upon his allies, which sees their bodies bloat with great wobbling mounds of grey-green fat._

Abundance of Flesh: Abundance of Flesh is a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 14". If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly MAGGOTKIN OF NURGLE MORTAL unit within range and visible to the caster. Add 1 to the Wounds characteristic of that unit until your next hero phase.Designer’s Note: This can result in a model that is affected by this spell being slain if the wounds allocated to that model equal or exceed its Wounds characteristic once the effect of the spell ends.
