# Bloab Rotspawned

_One of Nurgle’s most favoured sorcerers, Bloab Rotspawned is accompanied at all times by a swarm of daemonic flies that emerge from his bubotic flesh, to the detriment of any who dare draw too close._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Contagium Overlord

## Mount

## Wizard

## Daemon-Flies

_The whirling fly-storm that surrounds Bloab blinds and chokes his victims._

Daemon-flies: At the start of the combat phase and the enemy shooting phase, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 7" of this unit. On a 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound and subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made by that enemy unit in that phase.

## Windspeaker Bells

_The dolorous tolling of these bells disrupts the focus of enemy mages but helps Bloab to concentrate when he is weaving his own spells._

Add 1 to casting rolls for this unit. In addition, subtract 1 from casting rolls for enemy WIZARDS that are within 14" of this unit.

## Miasma Of Pestilence

_Bloab Rotspawned completes a complicated gesture in the air and a vile mist rises from the ground around his target. While it lasts, even the lightest graze seems to turn gangrenous._

Miasma of Pestilence: Miasma of Pestilence is a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 14". If successfully cast, pick 1 enemy unit within range and visible to the caster. Until your next hero phase, roll a dice at the end of each phase in which any wounds or mortal wounds were allocated to that unit. On a 2+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
