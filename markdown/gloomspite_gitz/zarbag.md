# Zarbag

_Zarbag the shaman has wandered the twisted halls of the Nightvault for as long as he can remember. His sniffer spite helps him root out the best magic fungi, and he can transform his facial features into a warped vision of horror almost at will._

## Jealous Hex

_With a vindictive sneer, Zarbag utters a curse upon an enemy champion in order to bring them down a peg or two._

Jealous Hex is a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 18". If successfully cast, pick 1 enemy HERO within range and visible to the caster. Until the start of your next hero phase, ignore positive modifiers to hit rolls and wound rolls for attacks made by that HERO, and ignore positive modifiers to save rolls for attacks that target that HERO.

## Face Of Da Bad Moon

_To Zarbag, ‘mooning the enemy’ has a very different - and terrifying - meaning..._

Face of Da Bad Moon: Face of Da Bad Moon is a spell that has a casting value of 5 and a range of 9". If successfully cast, pick 1 enemy unit within range and visible to the caster. That unit must retreat. If it is impossible for the unit to retreat for any reason, it suffers D6 mortal wounds instead.
