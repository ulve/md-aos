# Grinkrak the Great

_A denizen of the Gnarlwood, Grinkrak holds court around the ‘Great Stinkhorn’ – a particularly colossal mushroom. His latest scheme is to ‘knight’ his grot minions using his bossin’ stikk, filling the greenskins with a sort of bravery._

This unit has a ward of 6+.

## ‘I Dub Thee…’

_Grinkrak has fooled his followers into believing themselves actual knights, blessed by his bossin’ baton. In truth, he just needs some grots to do his bidding, and the accompanying pomp and ceremony ensures they give it their all._

At the start of the combat phase, you can pick 1 other friendly MOONCLAN unit within 3" of this unit to be dubbed. If you do so, until the end of that phase, if any models in that unit are slain, those models can fight before they are removed from play.
