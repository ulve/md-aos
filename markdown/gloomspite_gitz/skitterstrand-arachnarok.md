## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Skitterstrand Nest

## Ambush From Beyond

_Skitterstrand Arachnaroks stalk their prey through the arcane paths that connect the realms._

During deployment, instead of setting up this unit on the battlefield, you can place it to one side and say that it is set up in ambush as a reserve unit. At the end of your movement phase, you can set up any friendly units that are in ambush on the battlefield more than 9" from all enemy units. In addition, at the end of the combat phase, you can say that this unit will ambush again. If you do so, remove it from the battlefield. It is set up in ambush as a reserve unit once more.

## Spider Venom

_An Arachnarok Spider monstrous fangs glisten with deadly toxic venom._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this unit’s Monstrous Fangs is 6, that attack causes 3 mortal wounds to the target and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound roll or save roll).

## Wall Crawler

_The Spiderfang’s arachnid allies can skitter up and down vertical surfaces as if they were flat ground._

When this unit makes a move, it can pass across terrain features in the same manner as a unit that can fly.
