# Arachnarok Spider with Flinger

_Some Arachnarok Spiders bear howdahs upon their backs that have flinger catapults built into them. Operated by a cackling grot crew, these weapons lob tumbling masses of envenomed webbing that slam down to entangle and poison the enemy._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Arachnarok Spider Cluster

## Crew

CREW: This unit is accompanied by a Spiderfang grot crew armed with Spider-bows and Crooked Spears.

## Flinger

_This crude catapult hurls a heavy hall of corded spider-silk at the enemy. Any victims not crushed by the missile when it lands are engulfed by the mass of sticky webbing as it explosively unfurls._

The Attacks characteristic of a Flinger is equal to the number of models in the target unit, to a maximum of 20. In addition, if any attacks made with this unit’s Flinger score a hit, after those attacks have been resolved, roll a dice. On a 2+, the target unit is entangled until the start of your next hero phase. While a unit is entangled, halve its Move characteristic. A unit cannot be entangled more than once at the same time.

## Spider Venom

_An Arachnarok Spider monstrous fangs glisten with deadly toxic venom._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this unit’s Monstrous Fangs is 6, that attack causes 3 mortal wounds to the target and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound roll or save roll).

## Wall Crawler

_The Spiderfang’s arachnid allies can skitter up and down vertical surfaces as if they were flat ground._

When this unit makes a move, it can pass across terrain features in the same manner as a unit that can fly.
