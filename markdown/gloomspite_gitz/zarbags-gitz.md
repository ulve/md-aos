# Zarbag’s Gitz

_This dubious bunch of greenskin hooligans have followed Zarbag into countless dangerous and often ludicrous situations, and have demonstrated a talent for emerging more or less in one piece with heaps of glinting shinies to show for it._

## Netters

_Moonclan grots use throwing nets to capture Cave Squigs and entangle their foes._

Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made by enemy units while they are within 1" of any friendly units that include any models armed with a Barbed Net.

## Snirk Sourtongue

_Drunk on fungus brew, when the deranged Snirk Sourtongue spots the enemy, the rest of Zarbag’s Gitzpush him away as quickly as possible, for he is impossible to stop once he starts whirling his ball and chain._

The first time this unit is set up on the battlefield, 1 LOONSMASHA FANATICS unit consisting of 1 model is added to your army and hidden within this unit as a reserve unit.

## ‘Protect Da Boss!’

_Zarbag’s Gitz try to protect their boss in battle, for if he gets hurt and survives, they know they’ll suffer for it!_

Before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to a friendly ZARBAG, or instead of making a ward roll for a wound or mortal wound that would be allocated to a friendly ZARBAG, if this unit is within 3" of that friendly ZARBAG, you can roll a dice. On a 1-2, that wound or mortal wound is allocated to that ZARBAG as normal. On a 3+, that wound or mortal wound is allocated to this unit instead.
