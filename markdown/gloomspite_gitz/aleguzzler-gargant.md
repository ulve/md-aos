# Aleguzzler Gargant

_Aleguzzler Gargants that accompany Gloomspite hordes into battle are often combating raging hangovers from drinking too much crude fungus brew. They fight for more barrels of the same foul stuff, so that they can get inebriated all over again._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Troggherd

## Drunken Stagger

_Often still inebriated, Aleguzzlers can lurch forwards with surprising speed -buttheir sozzled clumsiness makes them just as dangerous to their allies as their enemies._

You can attempt a charge with this unit if it is within 18" of the enemy instead of 12", In addition, roll 3D6 instead of 2D6 when making a charge roll for this unit. However, if a charge roll for this unit includes three dice that show the same number before modifiers are applied, this unit cannot make a charge move in that phase and the players must roll off. The winner must pick a point on the battlefield 3" from this unit. Each unit within 2" of that point suffers D3 mortal wounds.

## Stuff’em In Me Bag

_Gargants are known to grab hapless warriors and stuff them screaming into their bags ‘for later’..._

Stuff’Em In Me Bag: After this unit piles in, you can pick 1 enemy model within 3" of it and roll a dice. If the roll is at least double that model’s Wounds characteristic, it is slain.

## Timber!

_A dying gargant is a weapon of ruin in its own right, though it is anyone’s guess where - and on whom - their body will fall._

If this model is slain, before removing the model from the battlefield, the players must roll off. The winner picks a point on the battlefield 3" from the slain model. Each unit within 2" of that point that is not a GARGANT or a MEGA-GARGANT suffers D3 mortal wounds. The slain model is then removed from the battlefield.
