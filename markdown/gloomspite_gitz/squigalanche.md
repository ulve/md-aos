# Squigalanche

_The grots of a Squigalanche range nomadically across the Mortal Realms in search of the Bad Moon. Some seek to catch up to it and sink their mountsâ€™ fangs into its rocky hide, others to bound clean over it or stop it in its tracks just to prove they can. Whatever their goal, anything that gets between them and the Bad Moon is sure to suffer._
