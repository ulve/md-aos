# Madcap Shaman

_Black-clad Madcap Shamans caper into battle, chanting and jabbering madly. They stuff Madcap Mushrooms into their gobs, eyes crackling with power as they channel the Gloomspite into deadly magical attacks._

## Madcap Mushroom

_This mushroom enhances the eater’s magical capabilities - as long as it does not turn out to be a deadly poisonous Madcap Toadstool..._

Once per battle, in your hero phase, you can say this unit will eat its Madcap Mushroom. If you do so, this unit can attempt to cast 1 additional spell in that phase. If it does so and the casting roll is a double, this unit suffers D3 mortal wounds after the effect of the spell has been resolved.

## Night Shroud

_The shaman throws a black-capped Nightshade Mushroom into the air, which bursts to form a cloud of pitch darkness._

Night Shroud is a spell that has a casting value of 5 and a range of 12". If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly GLOOMSPITE GITZ unit wholly within range and visible to the caster. Until the start of your next hero phase, subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made with missile weapons that target that unit.
