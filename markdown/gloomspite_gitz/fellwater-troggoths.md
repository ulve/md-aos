# Fellwater Troggoths

_These slime-slick beasties stink worse than a plague pit full of incontinent Nurglings. They throw up jetting streams of viciously corrosive vomit, softening their prey up - quite literally - before tearing into them with wicked talons and tusks._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Troggherd

## Regeneration

_Troggoths are able to regrow injured flesh almost as quickly as it is harmed._

At the start of the hero phase, you can heal up to D3 wounds allocated to this unit.

## Terrible Stench

_Fellwater Troggoths are slimy creatures that reek so foully of rotten fish that it makes their enemies gag._

Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made with melee weapons by enemy units while they are within 3" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Noxious Vomit

_The bilious digestive fluids chucked up by a Fellwater Troggoth can swiftly corrode even sigmarite plate._

If any wounds caused by this unit’s Noxious Vomit are allocated to an enemy unit and not negated, that enemy unit is drenched in vomit until the start of your next hero phase. While a unit is drenched in vomit, subtract 1 from save rolls for attacks that target that unit, and ignore positive modifiers to save rolls for attacks that target that unit. A unit cannot be drenched in vomit more than once at the same time.
