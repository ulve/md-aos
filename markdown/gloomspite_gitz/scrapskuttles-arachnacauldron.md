# Scrapskuttle’s Arachnacauldron

_Scrapskuttle’s Arachnacauldron fumes with sorcerous energies, and a shaman who drinks of its foul fluids feels magical knowledge burn through their brain. Yet the cauldron squeals always with idiot hunger, and there is a price to be paid for the arcane power it bestows._

## Bloodslither Pact

_Scrapskuttle’s Arachnacauldron only imparts its gifts when live victims are plunged screaming into the bubbling broth that sloshes around in its iron belly. If no enemies are nearby, then allies or even the caster will have to be sacrificed!_
