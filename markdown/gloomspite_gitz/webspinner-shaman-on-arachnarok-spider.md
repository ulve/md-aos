# Webspinner Shaman on Arachnarok Spider

_Especially old and malevolent Arachnarok Spiders often bear a Webspinner Shaman and his mob of hangers-on into battle. The shaman draws power from his howdah’s catchweb spidershrine to boost his ability to weave spells and unravel those of the foe._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Arachnarok Spider Cluster

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 2 spells in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 1 spell in the enemy hero phase.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Arachnarok Spider is armed with Chitinous Legs and Monstrous Fangs.

## Crew

CREW: This unit has a Spiderfang grot crew armed with Spider-bows and Crooked Spears.

## Catchweb Spidershrine

_This ramshackle altar to the Spider God shimmers with malevolent arcane energy._

Add 1 to casting rolls and unbinding rolls for friendly SPIDERFANG WIZARDS while they are wholly within 12" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Spider Venom

_An Arachnarok Spider’s monstrous fangs glisten with deadly toxic venom._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this unit’s Monstrous Fangs is 6, that attack causes 3 mortal wounds to the target and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound roll or save roll).

## Wall Crawler

_The Spiderfang’s arachnid allies can skitter up and down vertical surfaces as if they were flat ground._

When this unit makes a move, it can pass across terrain features in the same manner as a unit that can fly.
