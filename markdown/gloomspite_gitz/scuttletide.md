# Scuttletide

_First comes a weird whispering, a rising scrape and skitter like a wind through dry leaves. Then the Scuttletide spills out onto the battlefield, sorcerous spiders by the thousand squeezing from cracks in the ground and surging from shadows and undergrowth to overrun and frenziedly bite everything in their path._

_SUMMONING: This endless spell is summoned with a spell that has a casting value of 7. Add 1 to casting rolls for this spell if the caster is a SPIDERFANG WIZARD. If successfully cast, set up this endless spell within 8" of a terrain feature that is visible to the caster, and more than 1" from all models, other endless spells and invocations. Only GLOOMSPITE GITZ WIZARDS can attempt to summon this endless spell._

## Predatory

PREDATORY: This endless spell is a predatory endless spell. It can be moved up to 8".

## Scuttling Horde

_A Scuttletide seethes across the battlefield, biting and poisoning anything that gets in its way or that approaches too closely._

After this endless spell has moved, the commanding player can pick 1 unit within 1" of this endless spell and roll 8 dice. For each 5+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound. In addition, roll 8 dice for each unit that finishes a normal move, run, retreat or charge move within 6" of this endless spell. For each 5+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound. SPIDERFANG units are not affected by this ability.

## Endless Terrors

_The sorcerous energies of the Scuttletide are bolstered by nearby Arachnaroks, drawing forth wave after wave of the crawling critters and making them near impossible to get rid of._

While this endless spell is wholly within 12" of any ARACHNAROK units, it can only be dispelled with a dispelling roll of 9+.
