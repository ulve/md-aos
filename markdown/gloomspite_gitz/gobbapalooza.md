# Gobbapalooza

_A Gobbapalooza is a motley gathering of petty shamans and other wise-grots, each employing a different set of superstitions, practices and volatile fungus brews that either bolster their fellow greenskins with all sorts of bizarre effects or cause mayhem amongst the ranks of the enemy._
