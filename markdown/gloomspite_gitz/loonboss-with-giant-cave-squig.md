# Loonboss with Giant Cave Squig

_Some particularly forceful and bullying Loonbosses are able to tame - in the loosest sense of the word - Giant Cave Squigs and bring them into battle as terrifying pets that are more than capable of biting a man in two._

## Goin’ Somewhere?

_This Loonboss will not tolerate ill-timed cowardice from his underlings, and will have his ravenous pet make an example of any grots who look ready to leg it._

At the start of the battleshock phase, you can pick 1 other friendly GLOOMSPITE GITZ GROT unit within 3" of this unit and say that the Loonboss will set his Cave Squig loose on them. If you do so, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds, but for each mortal wound it suffers, add 3 to its Bravery characteristic until the end of the phase.

## Gobbled Up

_This especially bloated and gluttonous squig is known to devour enemies whole if it gets the chance._

At the end of the combat phase, pick 1 enemy model within 1" of this unit and roll a dice. If the roll is equal or greater than that model’s Wounds characteristic, it is slain.
