# Dankhold Troggoths

_Dankhold Troggoths sleep deep underground until the Gloomspite moves them to lumber up to the surface and wreak havoc. They swat and crush everything within reach, soak up spellcraft like sponges, and are nigh unkillable in battle._

## Regeneration

_Troggoths are able to regrow injured flesh almost as quickly as it is harmed._

At the start of the hero phase, you can heal up to D3 wounds allocated to this unit.

## Magical Resistance

_The realmstone-infused mushrooms that Dankhold Troggoths consume make them naturally resistant to the effects of magic._

Each time this unit is affected by a spell or the abilities of an endless spell, you can roll a dice. On a 4+, ignore the effect of that spell or the effects of that endless spell’s abilities on this unit.

## Squiggly-Beast Followers

_Dankhold Troggoths are accompanied by a horde of small, skittering cave-creatures that look to them for protection._

Squiggly-beast Followers: At the start of the combat phase, roll 1 dice for each enemy unit within 3" of any friendly units with this ability. If the roll is equal to or greater than the number of models in that enemy unit, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

## Crushing Grip

_The vice-like grasp of a Dankhold Troggoth can squeeze the life out of all but the largest opponent._

At the end of the combat phase, pick 1 enemy model within 1" of this unit and roll a dice. If the roll is equal to or greater than that model’s Wounds characteristic, it is slain.
