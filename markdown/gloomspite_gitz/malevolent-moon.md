# Malevolent Moon

_The Malevolent Moon is conjured when a shaman raises high a carved loonstone simulacrum of the Bad Moon and jabbers the right words. The statue swells into a cackling, glowing abomination that sweeps across the battlefield wreaking havoc._

_SUMMONING: This endless spell is summoned with a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 12". If successfully cast, set up this endless spell wholly within range and visible to the caster, and more than 1" from all models, other endless spells and invocations. Only GLOOMSPITE GITZ WIZARDS can attempt to summon this endless spell._

## Predatory

PREDATORY: This endless spell is a predatory endless spell. It can be moved up to 12" and can fly.

## Malevolent Intentions

_A Malevolent Moon crashes through its foes, biting and crushing them as it goes._

After this endless spell has moved, roll a dice for each unit within 3" of it. On a 2+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. GLOOMSPITE GITZ units are not affected by this ability.

## Lurid Light

_To the maniacal grots of the Gloomspite Gitz, one cackling lunar entity streaking through the sky is much like another._

While this endless spell is controlled by a model in a Gloomspite Gitz army, GLOOMSPITE GITZ units in the same army are affected by the Light of the Bad Moon while they are wholly within 12" of this endless spell.
