# Big Grikk’s Kruleshots

_Grikk swears that the massive, jagged bolt that buried itself in the back of his boss’s Corpse-rippa Vulcha had nothing to do with him. Few believed the treacherous Big Shot, so Grikk quickly took leave of his clan, taking with him a handful of crossbow-toting lackeys and some grots to drag his beloved killbow across the realms._
