## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Shadowstrike Starhost • Shadowstrike Temple-host

## Fly

FLY: This unit can fly.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Terradon is armed with Razor-sharp Jaws.

## Deadly Cargo

_Terradons carry heavy boulders hewn from meteoric rock and carved with sigils of destruction. When these are dropped upon enemy lines, those not immediately crushed are sent flying in all directions._

Once per battle, after this unit finishes a normal move or run, you can pick 1 enemy unit and roll a dice if this unit passed across any models in that enemy unit. On a 4+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. In addition, if any mortal wounds caused by this ability are allocated to that enemy unit, halve the Move characteristic of that enemy unit until your next hero phase.

## Deadly Cargo

_A Terradon Chief can direct their warriors so that they unleash their deadly cargo to maximum effect._

Coordinated Attack: Once per battle, at the start of your movement phase, you can pick 1 friendly unit with this ability on the battlefield to call a Terradon attack. If you do so, until the end of that phase, each time a friendly TERRADON unit wholly within 12" of that unit uses its Deadly Cargo ability, the enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds for each 2+ instead of each 4+.

## Attack From On High

_Terradons circle high in the sky, only darting down for a brief moment to launch a strafing run._

Attack from On High: Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made with missile weapons that target this unit.
