# Lord Kroak

_Despite his deathly state, Lord Kroak is the most powerful of all slann. The venerable Relic Priest appears unbidden when the Great Plan is most imperilled, the foes of the Seraphon laid to waste through an onslaught of arcane power._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Coalesced Eternity Guardians • Shadowstrike Starhost • Shadowstrike Temple-host • Starborne Eternity Guardians

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 4 spells in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 4 spells in the enemy hero phase. If this unit is part of a Starborne army, it knows all of the spells from the Lore of Celestial Domination in addition to the other spells it knows. If this unit is part of a Coalesced army, it knows all the spells from the Lore of Ancient Domains in addition to the other spells it knows.

## Warmaster

WARMASTER: If this unit is included in a Seraphon army, it is treated as a general even if it is not the model picked to be the army’s general.

## Fly

FLY: This unit can fly.

## Arcane Vassal

_A Slann Starmaster can channel the power of a spell through one of their followers._

Once per phase, when this unit attempts to cast a spell, before making the casting roll, you can pick either 1 friendly SKINK WIZARD within 12" of this unit or 1 friendly ORACLE anywhere on the battlefield. If you do so and the spell is successfully cast and not unbound, you must measure the range and visibility for that spell from that SKINK WIZARD or ORACLE.

## Azyrite Force Barrier

_Lord Kroak’s desiccated form is protected by a crackling energy field that blasts enemies who dare come close._

The Attacks characteristic of this unit’s Azyrite Force Barrier cannot be modified. Each time this unit attacks with its Azyrite Force Barrier, roll 1 dice for each enemy model within range. Roll 5 dice instead of 1 for each enemy MONSTER within range. On a 5+, that model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

## Dead For Innumerable Ages

_Lord Kroak is no longer alive in the conventional sense; his withered form is preserved only by his indomitable spirit. As a result, he is immune to all but the most devastating attacks._

Dead for Innumerable Ages: At the end of each phase, if any wounds are allocated to this model, roll 3D6 and add the number of wounds allocated to this model to the roll. On a 20+, this model is slain. On any other roll, heal all wounds allocated to this model.Designer’s Note: If Lord Kroak suffers 18 or more wounds before the end of a phase, he is immediately slain and no dice roll is made at the end of the phase.

## Impeccable Foresight

_Lord Kroak casts his mind into the future, reading the threads of destiny as easily as a mortal would read a map._

At the start of your hero phase, roll 3 dice for this unit. For each 4+, you receive 1 command point.

## Supreme Master Of Order

_The slann are amongst the greatest wizards in existence, but Lord Kroak is mighty even in comparison to others of his kind._

Supreme Master of Order: Add 2 to casting, dispelling and unbinding rolls for this unit. In addition, this unit can attempt to unbind enemy spells that are cast anywhere on the battlefield and attempt to dispel endless spells anywhere on the battlefield.

## Golden Death Mask

_The all-seeing gaze of Kroak’s impossibly ancient death mask is said to pierce the very soul._

At the start of the combat phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 12" of this unit and visible to it, and roll 2D6. If the roll is equal to or greater than that unit’s Bravery characteristic, the strike-last effect applies to that unit until the end of that phase.

## Celestial Deliverance

_Lord Kroak’s palanquin quivers with barely contained force before unleashing ruination on the enemies of the Seraphon._

Celestial Deliverance is a spell that has a casting value of 7 and a range of 12". This unit can attempt to cast this spell multiple times in your hero phase. Each time this spell is successfully cast, pick up to 3 different enemy units within range and visible to the caster. Each of those units suffers D3 mortal wounds.
