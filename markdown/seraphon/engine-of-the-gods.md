# Engine of the Gods

_Only in the most dire of circumstances will the Starmasters command an Engine of the Gods to be activated. Borne to battle atop a steadfast elder Stegadon, the power of these devices is unpredictable but often deadly to the enemies of the Seraphon._

_An Engine of the Gods is borne by a Stegadon armed with Massive Horns, Grinding Jaws and Crushing Stomps._

## Crew

CREW: This unit has a skink crew armed with Meteoric Javelins.

## Armoured Crest

_A Stegadon will turn to face a foe head on if it can, so that its thickly scaled crest can protect it from harm._

At the start of the combat phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this unit that has up to 5 models. If you do so, until the end of that phase, add 1 to save rolls for attacks made by that unit that target this unit.

## Steadfast Majesty

_Stegadons are near fearless beasts, and their stubborn refusal to back down when faced by even the most terrifying foes inspires great courage in nearby skinks._

Add 3 to the Bravery characteristic of friendly SKINK units that do not have the STEGADON keyword while they are wholly within 12" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Unstoppable Stampede

_Stegadons are nigh unstoppable as they crash through the midst of battle._

After this unit finishes a charge move, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 1" of this unit. On a 2+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
