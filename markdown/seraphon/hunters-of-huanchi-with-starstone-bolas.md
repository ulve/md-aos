# Hunters of Huanchi with Starstone Bolas

_Sometimes, the task entrusted to a Hunters of Huanchi cohort will force them to close with an enemy. These Seraphon often wield deadly starstone bolas, close-quarters weapons that can explode in bursts of purging starlight._

_Chameleons lurking amid dense terrain are hard to spot._

This unit is not visible to enemy units that are more than 12" away or while it is in cover.

## Starstone Bolas

_A perfectly timed bolas throw can either ensnare an enemy or detonate to leave the foe reeling._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with a Starstone Bolas is 6, the target unit is stunned until the end of the following combat phase. Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made by a unit that is stunned.
