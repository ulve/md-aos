# Kroxigor Warspawned

_The Warspawned exist solely for bloodshed. Believed to be marked by the wrathful god Sotek, these Kroxigor are attended to with devotion by skink acolytes, whom they fight with rabid ferocity to defend in battle._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Thunderquake Starhost • Thunderquake Temple-host

## Skink Guidance

_The physical strength of these brutish creatures comes at the cost of their diminished intellect, and so Kroxigor rely on nearby skinks to direct them in battle._

Unit champions of SKINK units can issue commands to this unit if this unit is wholly within 12" of the SKINK unit.

## Heavy-Scaled Skin

_The scales of the Warspawned are especially thick and craggy, easily capable of repelling an arrow or musket ball._

Heavy-scaled Skin: Subtract 1 from wound rolls for attacks made with missile weapons that target this unit.

## Spawn Of Sotek

_Should any of the Serpent God’s devoted skink acolytes come to harm, Kroxigor Warspawned are overcome with a terrifying rage._

Spawn of Sotek: Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of this unit’s melee weapons until the end of the phase if any models in friendly SKINK units wholly within 12" of this unit have been slain in this phase.

## Vice-Like Jaws

_With rows of serrated iron-sharp fangs, few can survive the powerful bite of a Kroxigor._

Vice-like Jaws: Each time this unit fights, after all of its attacks have been resolved, pick 1 enemy unit within 1" of this unit and roll 3 dice for each model in this unit within 1" of that unit. These dice rolls are referred to as bite rolls. For each bite roll of 6+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.
