## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Shadowstrike Starhost • Shadowstrike Temple-host • The Celestial Stampede

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Stegadon is armed with Massive Horns, Grinding Jaws and Crushing Stomps.

## Crew

CREW: This unit has a skink crew armed with Meteoric Javelins and 1 of the following weapon options: Skystreak Bow; or Sunfire Throwers.

## Armoured Crest

_A Stegadon will turn to face a foe head on if it can, so that its thickly scaled crest can protect it from harm._

At the start of the combat phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this unit that has up to 5 models. If you do so, until the end of that phase, add 1 to save rolls for attacks made by that unit that target this unit.

## Coordinated Strike

_A Skink Chief mounted on a Stegadon is in the perfect position to direct the efforts of nearby skink warriors and warbeast handlers, amplifying their destructive power._

Once per turn, this unit can issue a command to a friendly SKINK unit without a command point being spent.

## Steadfast Majesty

_Stegadons are near fearless beasts, and their stubborn refusal to back down when faced by even the most terrifying foes inspires great courage in nearby skinks._

Add 3 to the Bravery characteristic of friendly SKINK units that do not have the STEGADON keyword while they are wholly within 12" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Sunfire Throwers

_These celestial weapons unleash great roiling clouds of cosmic flame._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with Sunfire Throwers. Instead, roll a number of dice equal to the number of models in the target unit that are within range of the attack. For each 5+, the target unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

## Unstoppable Stampede

_Stegadons are nigh unstoppable as they crash through the midst of battle._

After this unit finishes a charge move, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 1" of this unit. On a 2+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
