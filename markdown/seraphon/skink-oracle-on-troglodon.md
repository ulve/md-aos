# Skink Oracle on Troglodon

_Conduits of celestial magic, the Oracles are blessed with a portion of the slann’s magical might. They are the only skinks capable of taming the foul Troglodons, directing the loathsome beasts to slake their hunger on the enemies of the Seraphon._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Coalesced Eternity Guardians • Shadowstrike Starhost • Shadowstrike Temple-host • Starborne Eternity Guardians

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 1 spell in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 1 spell in the enemy hero phase.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Troglodon is armed with Noxious Spittle, Taloned Forelimbs and Venomous Jaws.

## Regeneration

_Troglodons are able to mend injured flesh almost as soon as they are harmed._

At the start of the hero phase, you can heal up to D3 wounds allocated to this unit.

## Stench Of Death

_These creatures bring the foul reek of their swampland homes to battle, offending the senses of those not accustomed to it._

Stench of Death: Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made by enemy units within 9" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Terror

_This terrifying monstrosity strikes fear into the hearts of its foes._

Enemy units cannot receive the Inspiring Presence command while they are within 3" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Venomous Spittle

_The venom that drips from a Troglodon’s jaws is extremely toxic and highly corrosive._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this unit’s Noxious Spittle or Venomous Jaws is 6, that attack causes a number of mortal wounds to the target equal to the weapon’s Damage characteristic and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound roll or save roll).

## Primordial Mire

_Wielding reality-shifting powers that are typically the province of the slann, an Oracle transmutes a portion of the battlefield into primal swampland, the favoured hunting ground of their Troglodon mounts._

Primordial Mire is a spell that has a casting value of 7 and a range of 12". If successfully cast, pick 1 objective or terrain feature within range and visible to the caster. Until your next hero phase, units within 3" of that objective or terrain feature cannot run or retreat and must halve the result of any charge rolls. This spell has no effect on SKINK units and units that can fly.
