# Starborne Realmshaper Engine

_Realmshaper Engines of the Starborne are teleported to the field using the vast portal-generating devices of the temple-ships. Once landed, they begin to expel waves of primal power, compelling the surrounding land to violently terraform._

* Points: **0**
* Battlefield Role: **Faction Terrain Feature**

_FACTION TERRAIN: Only Starborne armies can include this faction terrain feature._

## Impassable

IMPASSABLE: You cannot move a model over this terrain feature unless it can fly, and you cannot move a model onto this terrain feature or set up a model on this terrain feature (even if it can fly).

## Power Unleashed

_The waves of power that spread from an activated Realmshaper Engine bring the surrounding landscape to violent life._

In your hero phase, if there are any friendly SERAPHON WIZARDS within 3" of this terrain feature, you can pick 1 other terrain feature on the battlefield and roll a dice for each enemy unit within 3" of that terrain feature. Add 2 to the roll if that terrain feature is within 18" of this terrain feature, and subtract 2 from the roll if that terrain feature is more than 36" from this terrain feature. On a 4+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
