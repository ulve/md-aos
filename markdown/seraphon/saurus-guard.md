# Saurus Guard

_Patient and obstinate, Saurus Guard will not allow any harm to befall the Starmasters while even one of their number draws breath. Each will fight to the very last to defend their master, their polearms mercilessly hacking down the enemy._

## Selfless Protectors

_The Saurus Guard stand as a living shield between the leaders of the Seraphon and their foes._

Before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to a friendly SERAPHON HERO that is not a MONSTER, or instead of making a ward roll for a wound or mortal wound that would be allocated to a friendly SERAPHON HERO that is not a MONSTER, if this unit is within 3" of that friendly SERAPHON HERO, you can roll a dice. On a 1-2, that wound or mortal wound is allocated to that SERAPHON HERO as normal. On a 3+, that wound or mortal wound is allocated to this unit instead.

## Saurus Jaws

_A bite from this fearsome creature is strong enough to rip a limb off a lesser warrior or tear a massive blood chunk from the flank of a beast._

Each time this unit fights, after all of its attacks have been resolved, pick 1 enemy unit within 1" of this unit and roll 1 dice for each model in this unit within 1" of that unit. These dice rolls are referred to as bite rolls. For each bite roll of 6+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.
