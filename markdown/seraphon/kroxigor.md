# Kroxigor

_Taller and bulkier than even the most hulking saurus, each Kroxigor is a monstrously strong reptilian brute. They wade into battle alongside massed skink cohorts, crushing any who would threaten their diminutive cousins._

_This unit is referred to as a Kroxigor Cohort. Each model in a Kroxigor Cohort is armed with a Drakebite Maul. 1 in every 3 models can replace their Drakebite Maul with a Moonstone Hammer._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Thunderquake Starhost • Thunderquake Temple-host

## Skink Guidance

_The physical strength of these brutish creatures comes at the cost of their diminished intellect, and so Kroxigor rely on nearby skinks to direct them in battle._

Unit champions of SKINK units can issue commands to this unit if this unit is wholly within 12" of the SKINK unit.

## Sweeping Blows

_Kroxigor swing their weapons in wide arcs, smashing aside a multitude of foes with each blow._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with a Drakebite Maul or Moonstone Hammer is 6 and the target unit has 10 or more models, that attack scores 2 hits on the target instead of 1. Make a wound roll and save roll for each hit.

## Vice-Like Jaws

_With rows of serrated iron-sharp fangs, few can survive the powerful bite of a Kroxigor._

Vice-like Jaws: Each time this unit fights, after all of its attacks have been resolved, pick 1 enemy unit within 1" of this unit and roll 3 dice for each model in this unit within 1" of that unit. These dice rolls are referred to as bite rolls. For each bite roll of 6+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.
