# Saurus Scar-Veteran on Aggradon

_Many Scar-Veterans choose to fight from the back of ferocious Aggradons, the better to swiftly unleash savage violence on the foe. These saurus champions are adept at spurring the fury of their kin, and they excel as both warriors and strike leaders._

## Primal Rage

_The mere taste of enemy blood whips an Aggradon into a battle frenzy and sends the beast on a violent rampage._

At the end of each combat phase, if this unit is within 3" of any enemy units, increase its rage score by 1 (to a maximum of 3). At the end of each combat phase, if this unit is not within 3" of any enemy units, reset its rage score to 0. While this unit has a rage score of 1 or more, add its rage score to the Attacks characteristic of its Rending Bites and Striking Talons.

## Alpha Roar

_The Aggradons ridden by Scar-Veterans are the most violent examples of a brutal species. When they throw back their heads to unleash a earsplitting roar, their kin soon follow suit._

Once per battle, at the start of your combat phase, you can pick 1 friendly unit with this ability on the battlefield to unleash a feral roar. If you do so, increase the rage score of friendly AGGRADON units wholly within 18" of that unit by 1 (to a maximum of 3).
