## Sow Terror And Confusion

_Dark Riders wage a war of terror and confusion, striking at their enemy’s weakest points with merciless precision._

Sow Terror and Confusion: Roll a dice each time an enemy unit issues a command within 12" of any friendly units with this ability. On a 5+, that command is not received (it still counts as having been used) and the command point that was spent to issue that command is lost.
