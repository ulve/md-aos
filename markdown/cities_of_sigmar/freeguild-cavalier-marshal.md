# Freeguild Cavalier-Marshal

_Every Cavalier-Marshal is nigh-unstoppable on the charge. They gallop hard into the enemy, collapsing enemy battlelines in a single decisive attack. Though they often carry the weight of a Dawnbringer Crusade upon their shoulders, they are inspiring champions well used to leading by example._

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Warhorse is armed with Steel-shod Hooves.

## For Sigmar, Charge!

_With their blade raised high, the Marshal signals the charge of the Cavaliers._

When the ‘Their Finest Hour’ heroic action is carried out with this unit, in addition to the normal effect, until the end of the turn, add 3 to charge rolls for this unit and friendly FREEGUILD CAVALIERS units while they are wholly within 12" of this unit.

## Run Down The Foe

_With a Cavalier- Marshal at the helm, a well-timed charge of Freeguild riders can shatter the enemy’s formation before they even have a chance to strike back._

Run Down the Foe: The strike-first effect applies to this unit if it made a charge move in the same turn. In addition, in the combat phase, if this unit made a charge move in the same turn, after this unit has fought for the first time in phase, you can pick 1 friendly FREEGUILD CAVALIERS unit wholly within 12" of this unit and that has not yet fought in that phase. That unit can fight immediately.
