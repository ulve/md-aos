Two-headed: If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this unit’s Twin Beaks is 6, that attack scores 2 hits on the target instead of 1. Make a wound roll and save roll for each hit.

## Ghurish Ferocity

_The twin-headed griffons of Ghur ridden by Amber Battlemages are alpha predators that prey upon other megafauna._

Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of this unit’s Razor Claws and Twin Beaks for attacks that target enemy MONSTERS.

## Amber Spear

_The wizard conjures a magical amber spear that they hurl at the foe with uncanny accuracy._

Amber Spear has a casting value of 7. If successfully cast, pick 1 point on the battlefield within 18" of the caster that is visible to them and draw a straight line between that point and the closest point on the caster’s base. Roll a dice for each unit that has any models passed across by that line. On a 2+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds or 3 mortal wounds if it is a MONSTER.
