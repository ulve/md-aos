_An Assassin is armed with Poisoncoated Blades._

## Deathshead Poison

_Assassins utilise deadly blends of venom to ensure their mark is slain._

If the unmodified wound roll for an attack made with Poison-coated Blades is 6, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not make a save roll).

## Hidden Murderer

_Stalking the shadows, the Assassin only reveals their position when they launch a killing strike._

While this unit is within 3"of a friendly CITIES OF SIGMAR AELF unit that has 3 or more models, this unit is not visible to enemy models that are more than 12" away from it.

## In For The Kill

_With their target in sight, the Assassin bursts from the shadows and unleashes a flurry of attacks upon the unsuspecting victim._

In For the Kill: The strike-first effect applies to this unit if it made a charge move in the same turn.
