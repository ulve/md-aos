# Freeguild Steelhelms

_While the rank and file of the Freeguilds are often individually outmatched by the myriad threats they face in their mission to retake the realms, they have three things on their side: discipline, gutsy determination and their faith in Sigmar._

_Each model in a Freeguild Steelhelms unit is armed with a Freeguild Weapon_

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Castelite Formation

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be a Sergeant-at-Arms. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s melee weapons.

## Standard Bearer

STANDARD BEARER: 1 in every 10 models in this unit can be a Steelhelm Herald. Add 1 to the Bravery characteristic of this unit while it includes any Steelhelm Heralds.

## Battle Priest

BATTLE PRIEST: 1 model in this unit can be a Battle Priest.

## Consecrate The Land

_Bellowing Sigmarite hymns and catechisms, the Battle Priest purges the taint of Chaos from the land and consecrates it in the name of Sigmar._

Consecrate the Land:  At the end of your movement phase, if this unit includes a Battle Priest and is contesting an objective you control that is not contested by any enemy models, you can say that it will consecrate the land. If you do so, roll a dice. On a 3+, that objective is considered by you to be consecrated. Friendly CITIES OF SIGMAR HUMAN units have a ward of 6+ while they are contesting a consecrated objective. If your opponent gains control of a consecrated objective, it is no longer consecrated.

## Hold The Line

_Steelhelm regiments are drilled to fight as a coordinated whole, overcoming their opponents through unwavering spirit and weight of numbers._

Hold the Line:  Each time this unit receives the All-out Attack or All-out Defence command, you can pick 1 other friendly unit with this ability that is wholly within 12" of this unit and has not received any commands this phase. That unit receives the same command as this unit and the sequence ends.
