# Freeguild Marshal and Relic Envoy

_Freeguild Marshals who lead from the front are perhaps the most heroic of all. The respect they have won from their warriors is stronger than any shield, and their Relic Envoys ensure their orders always get to where they are needed. When battlelines clash, their skill with sword, hammer and pistol swiftly becomes clear._
