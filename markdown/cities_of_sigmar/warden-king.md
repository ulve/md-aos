## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Grudgebound War Throng

## Ancestral Grudgebearer

_Every Warden King knows the names of those who wronged their forebears. As they march out to defend or reclaim their holds, they seek the settle those grudges._

If this unit is picked to be your general, at the start of first battle round, you can pick 1 enemy unit to bear a grudge against. If you do so, until the end of the battle, if the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with a melee weapon by a friendly CITIES OF SIGMAR DUARDIN unit that targets that enemy unit is 6, that attack automatically wounds the target (do not make a wound roll).

## Fearless Leader

_Warden Kings are often first into the fray, with their oathsworn kin following closely in their wake swinging gromril hammers and settling grudges._

In the combat phase, after this unit has fought for the first time in that phase, you can pick 1 friendly CITIES OF SIGMAR DUARDIN unit that has not yet fought in that phase, is within 3" of an enemy unit and is wholly within 12" of this unit. That unit can fight immediately.
