# Freeguild Fusiliers

_Planting their pavises in the ground, Freeguild Fusiliers form up into a defensive line that is effectively a fortress battlement brought to the field. From this defensive position, they unleash continuous volleys of fire from their sturdy fusil-cannons amidst drifting clouds of blackpowder smoke._

## Fusiliers, Fire!

_When in position, Fusiliers unleash devastating volleys of fire into the enemy lines._

Each time a model shoots with a Fusil-cannon, if its unit is in a fortified position, use the Fortified Position weapon characteristics. Otherwise, use the Mobile weapon characteristics.

## Fortified Position

_Heavy pavises are slammed into the dirt, forming a wall of oak and iron as strong as a fortification._

At the start of the battle, this unit is in a fortified position. In addition, at the end of your movement phase, if this unit both remained stationary and was not set up in that phase, it can establish a fortified position. Once this unit is in a fortified position, it remains so until it moves or is removed from the battlefield. While this unit is in a fortified position, you can ignore negative modifiers to save rolls for attacks made with missile weapons that target it.

## Resupply Run

_As ammunition runs low, Blackpowder Squires are dispatched to bring fresh supplies to the line._

Once per battle, at the start of your shooting phase in the third or subsequent battle rounds, you can say that this unit will be resupplied by its Blackpowder Squire. If you do so, you can re-roll hit rolls for attacks made with missile weapons by this unit until the end of that phase.
