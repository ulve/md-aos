## Champion

CHAMPION: Severin Steelheart is the unit champion. If the target unit has 5 or more models, you can re-roll failed hit rolls for attacks made with that model’s Broadsword.

## Heroic Guard

_Steelheart’s Champions stand impervious and unyielding in the face of the enemy._

If an enemy unit finishes a charge move within ½" of this unit, add 1 to save rolls for attacks that target this unit until the end of that turn.

## Lay Low The Tyrants

_Once a Liberator shield wall has endured the charge of foes seeking to uproot them, bloody justice is dealt._

Lay Low the Tyrants: At the end of the combat phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit that is both within 1" of this unit and within 6" of an objective, and roll a dice. On a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
