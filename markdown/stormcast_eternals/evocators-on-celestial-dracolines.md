# Evocators on Celestial Dracolines

_Dracolines are fearsome beasts of Azyr whose roars can unman even the staunchest foes. When their savagery is allied with the magical prowess of an Evocator, the result is a force to be reckoned with._

## Thunderous Pounce

_A Dracoline builds energy as it charges towards the foe; as it pounces, it discharges that force through its claws in a blast of Azyrite power._

You can re-roll charge rolls for this unit.
