# Protectors

_As a Protector retinue advances, they spin their stormstrike glaives in intricate arcs. By doing so, they create shields of celestial force, safeguarding their comrades while the Paladins eagerly put their warrior skills to work._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Devastation Brotherhood • Hammerstrike Force

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be a Protector-Prime. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s Stormstrike Glaive.

## Starsoul Mace

_A starsoul mace blasts a being’s soul out of synchronicity with their mortal form, slaying them as surely as any death blow._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with a Starsoul Mace. Instead, roll a dice. On a 2+, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds.

## Shield Of The Storm

_Attacks are deflected by the Protectors’ weaving glaives._

Shield of the Storm: Add 1 to save rolls for attacks that target this unit if at least half of the models in this unit (rounding down) are armed with Stormstrike Glaives.
