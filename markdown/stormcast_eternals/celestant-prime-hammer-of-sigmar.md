Retribution from On High: Instead of setting up this unit on the battlefield, you can place it to one side and say that it is set up in the heavens as a reserve unit.

If this unit strikes from the heavens, set this unit up on the battlefield more than 9" from all enemy units.

## Orrery Of Celestial Fates

Orrery of Celestial Fates: Once per turn, before you make a hit or wound roll for an attack made by this unit, a save roll for an attack that targets this unit, or a run or charge roll for this unit, you can say that you will foresee the result of the roll. If you do so, instead of making the roll, you must choose the result of the roll. The result chosen for a D6 roll must be a whole number from 1 to 6, and the result chosen for a 2D6 roll must be a whole number from 2 to 12. The result cannot be re-rolled, but any modifiers are applied to it as normal.

## Eye Of The Celestial Storm

_The celestial storm brought by the Celestant-Prime makes it almost impossible for his foes to land a clean strike._

Eye of the Celestial Storm: This unit has a ward of 4+.
