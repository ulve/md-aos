# Knight-Draconis

_Only one who has truly bonded with a Draconith can become a Knight-Draconis. Such unity is symbolised by the flaming blades these champions wield, and they eagerly bring burning death to any foe that stands before them._

## Arcane Heritage

_Whether raised within the temple-vessels of the Seraphon or born in the wilds of the realms, every young Draconith has developed a resistance to the arcane._

Each time this unit is affected by a spell or the abilities of an endless spell, you can roll a dice. On a 4+, ignore the effect of that spell or the effects of that endless spell’s abilities on this unit.

## Draconic Flamestream

_A Draconith can unleash annihilating streams of wyrmflame with each exhalation._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with a Draconic Flamestream. Instead, roll a dice. On a 1-2, nothing happens. On a 3-4, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds. On a 5-6, the target suffers D6 mortal wounds.

## Wrath Of The Draconith

_At their champion’s command, the Stormdrake Guard loose the searing force of their mounts when their foe least expects it._

Wrath of the Draconith: Once per battle, in your hero phase, you can pick 1 friendly STORMDRAKE GUARD unit wholly within 12" of this unit that has not made a shooting attack in that phase. That unit can shoot.

## Dragged Into The Tempest

_Propelling themselves skywards with immense force, a Draconith drags their victims into the clouds to be torn asunder and hurled down onto the battlefield as a grisly ruin._

Dragged into the Tempest: In the combat phase, after all of this unit’s attacks have been resolved, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 1" of this unit and roll a dice. If the roll is greater than that unit’s Wounds characteristic, your opponent must pick 1 model in that unit. That model is slain.
