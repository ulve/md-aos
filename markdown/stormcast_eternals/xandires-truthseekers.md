# Xandire’s Truthseekers

_Armed with the Lantern Astrala, Calthia Xandire leads her fellows in search of Harrowdeep’s forgotten secrets. With her comes Dhoraz Giant-fell, who revels in each destructive swing of his hammer; Luxa Stormrider, who lets her proficiency with the bow speak for her; and Luxa’s aetherwing companion, Taros._

_The models in Xandire’s Truthseekers are Calthia Xandire, Dhoraz Giant‑fell and Luxa Stormrider. Calthia Xandire is armed with a Broadsword. Dhoraz Giant-fell is armed with a Great Hammer. Luxa Stormrider is armed with a Stormcaller Bow and Bow Stave._

## Companion

COMPANION: This unit is accompanied by the aetherwing Taros, who is armed with a Beak and Talons. Taros must remain within 1" of Luxa Stormrider. For rules purposes, Luxa Stormrider and Taros are treated as a single model.

## Blazing Arrows

_Luxa Stormrider’s rune-etched arrows glow as if they had a molten core._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this unit’s Stormcaller Bow is 6, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound roll or save roll).

## Kinetic Lodestone

_Dhoraz Giant-fell has been gifted a kinetic lodestone that can stop a charging foe in their tracks and turn their own momentum against them._

After an enemy unit finishes a charge move within 3" of Dhoraz Giant-fell, roll a dice. On a 3+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. If that unit has a mount or is a MONSTER, it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead of D3.

## Lantern Astrala

_This lantern is a relic of old Azyr capable of dissipating the thickest gloom. Channelling the lambent magical energies of the heavens, it leaves Sigmar’s enemies vulnerable to attack._

Once per turn, at the end of the charge phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 9" of this unit. Add 1 to hit rolls for attacks made by friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS units that target that enemy unit in the following combat phase.
