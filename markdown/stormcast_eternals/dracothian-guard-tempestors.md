# Dracothian Guard Tempestors

_To become a Tempestor, a Stormcast must prove themselves a master marksman, maintaining pinpoint fire even while fighting atop a fierce Dracoth. Their volleystorm crossbows spit a constant stream of blazing death into the foe._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with a Stormblast. Instead, roll a dice. On a 4+, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds.

## Volleystorm

_Tempestors are trained to unleash an avalanche of fire upon the foe._

If an attack made with a Volleystorm Crossbow scores a hit, that attack scores 2 hits on the target instead of 1. Make a wound and save roll for each hit.
