_Each model in a Stormdrake Guard unit is armed with 1 of the following weapon options: Drakerider's Lance; or Drakerider's Warblade._

## Monstrous Regiment

MONSTROUS REGIMENT: Only 1 model in this unit can carry out a monstrous rampage each turn.

## Fly

FLY: This unit can fly.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Draconith are each armed with a Draconic Flamestream and Draconic Fangs and Talons.

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be a Stormdrake-Prime. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s Drakerider’s Lance or Drakerider’s Warblade.

## Dispersed Formation

_Stormdrake Guard are trained to fight in a widely dispersed formation._

If this unit has 2 to 5 models, it is coherent if each model in the unit is within 3" horizontally of at least 1 other model in the unit instead of 1". If this unit has more than 5 models, it is coherent if each model in the unit is within 3" horizontally of at least 2 other models in the unit instead of 1".

## Merciless Impact

_Should a foe be foolish enough to stand their ground against a charging Drakerider’s Lance, there will be little left of them after the impact._

This unit’s Drakerider’s Lances have a Rend characteristic of -2 instead of -1 and a Damage characteristic of 2 instead of 1 if this unit made a charge move in the same turn.

## Arcane Heritage

_Whether raised within the temple-vessels of the Seraphon or born in the wilds of the realms, every young Draconith has developed a resistance to the arcane._

Each time this unit is affected by a spell or the abilities of an endless spell, you can roll a dice. On a 4+, ignore the effect of that spell or the effects of that endless spell’s abilities on this unit.

## Draconic Flamestream

_A Draconith can unleash annihilating streams of wyrmflame with each exhalation._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with a Draconic Flamestream. Instead, roll a dice. On a 1-2, nothing happens. On a 3-4, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds. On a 5-6, the target suffers D6 mortal wounds.

## Dragged Into The Tempest

_Propelling themselves skywards with immense force, a Draconith drags their victims into the clouds to be torn asunder and hurled down onto the battlefield as a grisly ruin._

Dragged into the Tempest: In the combat phase, after all of this unit’s attacks have been resolved, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 1" of this unit and roll a dice. If the roll is greater than that unit’s Wounds characteristic, your opponent must pick 1 model in that unit. That model is slain.

## Draconic Onslaught

_To reclaim their old empire, the Draconith and their riders fight together as a single furious whole, savaging any who cross their path._

Once per battle, in your charge phase, you can say that this unit will unleash its draconic onslaught. If you do so, you can re-roll charge rolls for this unit in that phase.
