# Knight-Judicator with Gryph-hounds

_The masterful archers known as Knights-Judicator are akin to living artillery engines. Protected by their faithful Gryph-hound companions, they take up a commanding position early in the battle before raining pitiless, constant death from afar._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Lords of the Exemplar Chamber • Lords of the Harbinger Chamber • Lords of the Warrior Chamber

## Faithful Gryph-Hounds

_A Knight- Judicator is often accompanied into battle by a pair of these loyal beasts of Azyr._

Faithful Gryph-hounds: The first time this unit is set up on the battlefield, you must summon 1 GRYPH-HOUNDS unit consisting of 2 models to the battlefield and add it to your army. Set up the GRYPH-HOUNDS unit wholly within 3" of this unit and more than 9" from all enemy units.

## Gaze Of Sigmar

_When a Knight-Judicator calls upon the God-King to unleash his wrath, the cursed skies are split by a column of purifying light that slams into the enemy._

Gaze of Sigmar: Once per battle, in your shooting phase, you can say that this unit will draw the gaze of Sigmar instead of attacking with its missile weapons. If you do so, pick 1 point on the battlefield within 30" of this unit and visible to it. Roll a dice for each enemy unit within 6" of that point. On a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
