# Lord-Arcanum on Tauralon

_Lord-Arcanums who ride Tauralons are masters of the heavens. From their lofty vantage point, they unleash a hurricane of Azyrite magics, while those who fight in their wake are invigorated by the magical wake left by the great winged beast._

## Cycle Of The Storm

_A Lord-Arcanum is capable of capturing the soul-stuff of a fallen Stormcast Eternal, returning it to the battlefield to continue the fight._

Cycle of the Storm: Once per turn, before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to another friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS unit within 18" of this unit, and that wound or mortal wound would cause a model in that unit to be slain, you can say that this unit will capture and return that warrior’s soul. If you do so, that wound or mortal wound is negated.

## Lightning Orb

_Gathering the storm into a sphere of pure Azyrite force, the Lord-Arcanum hurls it into the enemy ranks._

Lightning Orb is a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 12". If successfully cast, pick 1 point on the battlefield within range and visible to the caster. Roll a dice for each enemy unit within 3" of that point. On a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
