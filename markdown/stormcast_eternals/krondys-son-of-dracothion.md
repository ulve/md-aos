## Blazing Tempest

## Calamitous Tail

_With a sweep of its destructive tail, a Draconith can deliver a killing blow to all those in its path._

The Attacks characteristic of a Calamitous Tail is equal to the number of enemy models within 3" of the attacking model.

## Regalia Fulmentarus

_This master-smithed halo symbolises the forging of the alliance between the Draconith and the Stormcast Eternals. Its divine power enhances the arcane strength of Krondys to even greater heights._

Add the Regalia Fulmentarus value shown on this unit’s damage table to casting rolls for this unit.
