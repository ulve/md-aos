# Lord-Arcanum on Gryph-charger

_It is not easy for a Lord-Arcanum to earn a Gryph-charger’s respect. Those who succeed gain an impossibly fleet mount, ensuring their sorceries can be unleashed wherever they are most needed._

## Cycle Of The Storm

_A Lord-Arcanum is capable of capturing the soul-stuff of a fallen Stormcast Eternal, returning it to the battlefield to continue the fight._

Cycle of the Storm: Once per turn, before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to another friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS unit within 18" of this unit, and that wound or mortal wound would cause a model in that unit to be slain, you can say that this unit will capture and return that warrior’s soul. If you do so, that wound or mortal wound is negated.

## Ride The Winds Aetheric

_Gryph-chargers can move faster than the eye can follow along the winds aetheric._

Ride the Winds Aetheric: Instead of picking this unit to make a normal move or retreat, you can say that it will ride the winds aetheric. If you do so, remove this unit from the battlefield and set it up again on the battlefield more than 1" from all terrain features and objectives and more than 9" from all enemy units.

## Healing Light

_The Lord-Arcanum gathers aetheric energy and uses it to revitalise the depleted life energies of nearby Stormcast warriors._

Healing Light is a spell that has a casting value of 5 and a range of 18". If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS unit within range. Heal up to D3 wounds allocated to that unit. If the unmodified casting roll was 8+, heal up to D6 wounds allocated to that unit instead.
