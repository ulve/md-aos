# Lord-Arcanum on Celestial Dracoline

_Lord-Arcanums who ride Dracolines favour bombastic, aggressive magics above all. They are often found hurling spears of scouring elemental force into the foe’s ranks while their bestial companion lopes forward to pounce._

## Cycle Of The Storm

_A Lord-Arcanum is capable of capturing the soul-stuff of a fallen Stormcast Eternal, returning it to the battlefield to continue the fight._

Cycle of the Storm: Once per turn, before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to another friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS unit within 18" of this unit, and that wound or mortal wound would cause a model in that unit to be slain, you can say that this unit will capture and return that warrior’s soul. If you do so, that wound or mortal wound is negated.

## Thunderous Pounce

_A Dracoline builds energy as it charges towards the foe; as it pounces, it discharges that force through its claws in a blast of Azyrite power._

You can re-roll charge rolls for this unit.

## Pack Alpha

_A Lord-Arcanum on Dracoline can urge their mount to issue a great roar to its loyal pack-mates, stoking their rage and ferocity to untold heights._

Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of Monstrous Claws used by friendly DRACOLINE units wholly within 18" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Storm Lance

_Thrusting their aetherstave forwards, the Lord-Arcanum summons a bolt of condensed Azyrite energy to spear through the ranks of the foe._

Storm Lance is a spell that has a casting value of 5 and a range of 12". If successfully cast, pick 1 point on the battlefield within range and visible to the caster and draw a straight line between that point and the closest part of the caster’s base. Roll a dice for each enemy unit passed across by that line. On a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
