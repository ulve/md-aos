# Retributors

_A Retributor retinue wields crushing lightning hammers, amongst the most unsubtle and devastating weaponry in the Stormhosts’ arsenal. By channelling the storm’s fury through these fearsome weapons, the Retributors strike the foe with annihilating force._

_Each model in a Retributors unit is armed with a Lightning Hammer. 2 in every 5 models can replace their Lightning Hammer with a Starsoul Mace._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Devastation Brotherhood • Hammerstrike Force

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be a Retributor-Prime. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s Lightning Hammer.

## Starsoul Mace

_A starsoul mace blasts a being’s soul out of synchronicity with their mortal form, slaying them as surely as any death blow._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with a Starsoul Mace. Instead, roll a dice. On a 2+, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds.

## Blast To Ashes

_A well-swung lightning hammer unleashes its pent-up energies in a great blast, destroying everything it strikes._

Blast to Ashes: If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with a Lightning Hammer is 6, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound or save roll).
