_Each model in an Annihilators with Meteoric Grandhammers unit is armed with a Meteoric Grandhammer._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Devastation Brotherhood • Hammerstrike Force

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be an Annihilator-Prime. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s Meteoric Grandhammer.

## Blazing Impact

_Annihilators arrive upon the field with devastating force, twin-tailed trails streaking behind them as an earth-shattering shockwave blasts apart the foes of Sigmar._

After this unit is set up on the battlefield for the first time, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 10" of this unit. On a 3+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. In addition, you can re-roll charge rolls for this unit if it was set up on the battlefield in the same turn.

## Force Of A Falling Star

_Annihilators move with comet-like force, and as they build up momentum, their blows and movements are followed by the same shock wave that accompanied their arrival._

Force of a Falling Star: After this unit makes a charge move, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 1" of this unit and roll a number of dice equal to the unmodified charge roll for that charge move. Subtract 1 from the roll if this unit only has 2 models. Subtract 2 from the roll if this unit only has 1 model. For each 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.
