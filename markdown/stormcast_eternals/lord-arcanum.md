## Cycle Of The Storm

_A Lord-Arcanum is capable of capturing the soul-stuff of a fallen Stormcast Eternal, returning it to the battlefield to continue the fight._

Cycle of the Storm: Once per turn, before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to another friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS unit within 18" of this unit, and that wound or mortal wound would cause a model in that unit to be slain, you can say that this unit will capture and return that warrior’s soul. If you do so, that wound or mortal wound is negated.

## Thunderclap

_The Lord-Arcanum gathers power from Azyr and unleashes a mighty thunderclap, stunning and deafening nearby enemies._

Thunderclap is a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 18". If successfully cast, pick 1 enemy unit within range and visible to the caster. Subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made by that unit until your next hero phase.
