## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Lords of the Exemplar Chamber • Lords of the Harbinger Chamber • Lords of the Warrior Chamber

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Dracoth is armed with a Stormblast and Claws and Fangs.

## Stormblast

_Dracoths can unleash the power of Sigmar’s storm from within their maws._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with a Stormblast. Instead, roll a dice. On a 4+, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds.

## Sigmarite Thundershield

_When struck with sufficient force, thundershields unleash stored storm energy to blast those attempting to attack._

If the unmodified save roll for an attack made with a melee weapon that targets this unit is 6, the attacking unit suffers 1 mortal wound after all of its attacks have been resolved.

## Furious Retribution

_Lord-Celestants lead their brethren in assaults upon the enemy lines, breaking the foe beneath their immortal fury._

Once per battle, this unit can issue the All-out Attack command to a friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS unit without a command point being spent.

## Impaling Strikes

_On the charge, the blade of a stormstrike glaive can impale several foes._

This unit’s Stormstrike Glaive has a Damage characteristic of 3 instead of 1 if this unit made a charge move in the same turn.

## Blast To Ashes

_A well-swung lightning hammer unleashes its pent-up energies in a great blast, destroying everything it strikes._

Blast to Ashes: If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with a Lightning Hammer is 6, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound or save roll).

## Cleaving Blow

_A single swing of a thunderaxe can carve through several foes._

Add 2 to the Attacks characteristic of a Thunderaxe if the number of models in the target unit is greater than the number of models in this unit.

## Tempestos Hammer

_With the momentum of the charge behind it, the impact of a tempestos hammer can fell a rampaging Ghorgon._

Add D3 to the Attacks characteristic of this unit’s Tempestos Hammer if this unit made a charge move in the same turn.
