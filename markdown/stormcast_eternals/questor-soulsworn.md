# Questor Soulsworn

_While the Questor Soulsworn still wear the colours of their Stormhost, they exist outside the chamber structure of Sigmar’s heavenly armies. Any Stormcast, be they lord or line warrior, may receive this call. Upon answering, they swear temporary fellowship to the Soulsworn, charged with missions of the grandest import._

Once per battle, in your hero phase, you can say that this unit is being guided to glory. When you do so, remove this unit from the battlefield and set it up again anywhere on the battlefield more than 9" from all enemy units. It cannot move in the following movement phase.

## Ordained Quest

_Soulsworn often travel deep into enemy territory to gain control of a vital landmark that conceals valuable secrets._

For the purposes of contesting objectives wholly outside your territory, each model in this unit counts as 3 models.
