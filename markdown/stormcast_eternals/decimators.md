# Decimators

_The advance of the Decimators is marked by piles of butchered corpses. These Paladins are remorseless in eradicating Sigmar’s enemies and, armed with their brutal thunderaxes, never tire when cleaving through hordes of the hateful foe._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Devastation Brotherhood • Hammerstrike Force

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be a Decimator-Prime. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s Thunderaxe.

## Starsoul Mace

_A starsoul mace blasts a being’s soul out of synchronicity with their mortal form, slaying them as surely as any death blow._

Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with a Starsoul Mace. Instead, roll a dice. On a 2+, the target suffers D3 mortal wounds.

## Cleaving Blow

_A single swing of a thunderaxe can carve through several foes._

Add 2 to the Attacks characteristic of a Thunderaxe if the number of models in the target unit is greater than the number of models in this unit.
