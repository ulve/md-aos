## Empower

WIZARD: This unit is a WIZARD while this unit has 2 models. It can attempt to cast 1 spell in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 1 spell in the enemy hero phase. It only knows the Empower spell and cannot attempt to cast any other spells. Any number of EVOCATORS units can attempt to cast Empower in the same hero phase.

## Celestial Lightning Arc

_Evocators summon bands of celestial lightning that arc around their weapons._

After this unit has fought for the first time in a phase and all of its attacks have been resolved, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 3" of this unit. Roll 2 dice for each model in this unit. For each 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound.

## Empower

_When gathered in enough numbers, Evocators can empower themselves or their comrades._

Empower is a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 12". If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly REDEEMER or SACROSANCT unit wholly within range. Add 1 to wound rolls for attacks made by that unit until your next hero phase.
