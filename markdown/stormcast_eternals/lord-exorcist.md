_A Lord-Exorcist is armed with a Redemption Stave._

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 1 spell in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 1 spell in the enemy hero phase.

## Redemptor Casket

_Each redemption stave incorporates a casket for the containment of malicious spirits._

Slain models cannot be returned to enemy units that are within 9" of any friendly units with this ability.

## Purifying Blast

_Slamming his stave onto the ground, the Lord-Exorcist unleashes a wave of power that blasts the spirits of the unworthy from their bodies._

Purifying Blast is a spell that has a casting value of 5 and a range of 12". If successfully cast, roll a dice for each enemy unit within range. Add that unitâ€™s Bravery characteristic to the roll. If the result is 12 or less, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
