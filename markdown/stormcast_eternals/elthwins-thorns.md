# Elthwin’s Thorns

_The soulpod grove in which Elthwin’s lamentiri was incubated was ransacked by ghouls and touched with maddening energies. Over time, the spirit-song that naturally envelops her fellow Sylvaneth has become torturously faint to Elthwin, and it is only the Arch-Revenant’s strength of will that has staved off insanity._
