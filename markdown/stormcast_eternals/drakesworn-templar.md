# Drakesworn Templar

_Drakesworn Templars are rare souls, Stormcasts pure enough to forge a bond with a noble Stardrake. They are the lieutenants of the Extremis chambers, each capable of turning the tide of battle through their deeds._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Drakesworn Temple

## Fly

FLY: This unit can fly.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Stardrake is armed with a Rain of Stars, Great Claws and Sweeping Tail.

## Arcane Lineage

_Stardrakes are the children of Dracothion, and they possess innate power over the magic of the realms._

Add 1 to casting rolls for friendly WIZARDS within 18" of this unit and subtract 1 from casting rolls for enemy WIZARDS within 18" of this unit.

## Cavernous Jaws

_The enormous maw of a Stardrake can bite a foe in half._

After this unit makes a pile-in move, you can say that this unit’s Stardrake will bite the enemy with its cavernous jaws. If you do so, pick a number of enemy models within 3" of this unit equal to or less than the Cavernous Jaws value shown on this unit’s damage table, and roll a dice for each. If the roll is greater than that model’s Wounds characteristic, it is slain.

## Arc Hammer

_The static hum of an arc hammer rises to an almighty concussive crescendo as it strikes._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with an Arc Hammer is 6, that attack scores 2 hits on the target instead of 1. Make a wound and save roll for each hit.

## Stormlance

_When fighting fearsome creatures, a well-placed blow from a stormlance channels the power of Sigmar into the unfortunate beast._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with a Stormlance that targets a MONSTER is 6, the target suffers D6 mortal wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound or save roll).

## Tempest Axe

_The hurricane force emanating from a tempest axe is enough to slow the foe’s attack._

Enemy models within 3" of a unit armed with a Tempest Axe cannot move more than 1" when making a pile-in move.

## Celestial Blast

_Skyboit bows can unleash a deadly blast of celestial energy when they strike a foe._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with a Skybolt Bow is 6, the target suffers 1 mortal wound and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound or save roll).
