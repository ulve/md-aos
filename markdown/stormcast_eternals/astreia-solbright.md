## Cycle Of The Storm

_A Lord-Arcanum is capable of capturing the soul-stuff of a fallen Stormcast Eternal, returning it to the battlefield to continue the fight._

Cycle of the Storm: Once per turn, before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to another friendly STORMCAST ETERNALS unit within 18" of this unit, and that wound or mortal wound would cause a model in that unit to be slain, you can say that this unit will capture and return that warrior’s soul. If you do so, that wound or mortal wound is negated.

## Thunderous Pounce

## Lightning Pulse

_With electricity pulsing from her eyes, Astreia gathers the power of Azyr into herself and then releases it as a blinding, expanding dome of lightning._

Lightning Pulse is a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 6". If successfully cast, subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made by enemy units within range until your next hero phase.
