# Man-skewer Boltboyz

_The fiendish crossbows wielded by the Man-skewer Boltboyz are powerful enough to take down a charging grunta with one shot, while the poisons coating their projectiles induce spasming deaths that are highly entertaining to these cruel orruks._

_Each model in a Man-skewer Boltboyz unit is armed with a Man-skewer Crossbow and Jaggedy Blade._

## Champion

CHAMPION: 1 model in this unit can be a Boltboy Boss. Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of that model’s missile weapons.

## Pick ’Em Off

_Boltboyz prefer to keep well away from the main battleline when possible, remaining stationary to fire carefully aimed shots at their enemies._

When this unit attacks with a Man-skewer Crossbow, use the Aimed Shot missile weapon characteristics if it did not make a normal move in the same turn and is more than 3" from all enemy units. Otherwise, use the Hasty Shot missile weapon characteristics.
