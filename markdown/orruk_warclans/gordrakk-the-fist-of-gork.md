# Gordrakk, the Fist of Gork

_Gordrakk is the mightiest of all orruks, a living embodiment of the power of Gorkamorka. From atop his armoured Maw-krusha, Bigteef, the Fist of Gork fights at the head of his Great Waaagh!, brutally crushing the mightiest enemy warriors._

_Gordrakk, the Fist of Gork, is armed with Smasha and Kunnin’._

## Warmaster

WARMASTER: If this unit is included in an Orruk Warclans army, it is treated as a general even if it is not the model picked to be the army’s general.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Maw-krusha is armed with an Innard-bursting Roar and its Mighty Fists and Tail.

## Fly

FLY: This unit can fly.

## Destructive Bulk

_A Maw-krusha is an unstoppable avalanche of ill-tempered muscle that turns all in its path into pulverised meat._

If you carry out a Stomp monstrous rampage with this unit and the enemy unit you picked suffers any mortal wounds, that enemy unit suffers an additional number of mortal wounds equal to the Destructive Bulk value on this unit’s damage table. After all models slain by those mortal wounds have been removed from play, if there are no enemy models within 3" of this unit, you can move this unit D6" and then you can carry out another Stomp monstrous rampage with this unit even though you have already carried out the Stomp monstrous rampage in that phase.

## Smasha

_Smasha is filled with the brutal power of Gork, making it especially lethal to enemy champions._

If the unmodified wound roll for an attack made with Smasha is 4+ and the target is a HERO but not a WIZARD, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not make a save roll).

## Kunnin’

_Kunnin’ is filled with the power of Mork and eagerly seeks out enemy wizards to slay._

If the unmodified wound roll for an attack made with Kunnin’ is 4+ and the target is a WIZARD, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds and the attack sequence ends (do not make a save roll).

## Voice Of Gork

_Gordrakk’s bellow carries the elemental force of his god and inspires his forces to surge into the enemy, hacking, bludgeoning and stomping with furious abandon._

Voice of Gork: This unit can issue the same command up to 3 times in the same phase. If it does so, no command point is spent the second and third times this unit issues that command in that phase.

## Strength From Victory

_The more fights a Megaboss wins, the stronger he becomes._

At the end of the combat phase, if any models were slain by a wound caused by an attack made by this unit in that combat phase, add 1 to this unit’s Wounds characteristic and add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of this unit’s melee weapons, excluding those of its mount.
