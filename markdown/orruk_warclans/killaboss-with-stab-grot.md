# Killaboss with Stab-grot

_Killabosses are the warlords of the Kruleboyz. Each has wrested their position from rivals by being not only a potent warrior but also possessed of true Morkish kunnin’, willing to use anyone or anything to garner an advantage._

## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Jab Finga • Thumb • The Weeping Fangz

## Shield

SHIELD: If this unit is armed with a Boss-hacka and Skareshield, it has a Save characteristic of 3+ instead of 4+.

## Companion

COMPANION: This unit’s Stab-grot is armed with a Prized Shiv. The Stab-grot must remain within 1" of the Killaboss. For rules purposes, the Killaboss and Stab-grot are treated as a single model.

## All Part Of Da Plan

_Kruleboyz and their allies tend to be very impressed by a Killaboss’s kunnin’ feats - so long as the boss has a plan, they are willing to face down even the most unlikely odds._

All Part of Da Plan: If a friendly KRULEBOYZ unit fails a battleshock test within 3" of any friendly units with this ability, only 1 model from that unit will flee.

## You Hold ’Em Off

_A Killaboss is not above using their Stab-grot lackey as a living shield when things get dicey._

Before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to this unit, or instead of making a ward roll for this unit, you can choose to risk this unit’s Stab-grot. If you do so, you must roll a dice. On a 1-5, the Stab-grot is killed and the wound is negated. On a 6, the Stab-grot is not killed and the wound is negated. If the Stab-grot is killed, the model representing it is removed from play before the wound is negated.
