# Orruk Warchanter

_The booming rhythm of a Warchanter’s drumming draws orruks to battle from miles around. As the tempo of violence increases, so does the furious energy of a Warchanter’s beat, driving those Ironjawz nearby into a destructive frenzy._

## Violent Fury

_Warchanters excel at stoking a wanton destructive fury in their lads._

In your hero phase, you can pick 1 friendly IRONJAWZ unit wholly within 15" of this unit. Until your next hero phase, add 1 to the damage inflicted by attacks made with melee weapons by that unit. A unit cannot benefit from this ability more than once per phase.
