## Battalions

BATTALIONS: This warscroll can be used in the following warscroll battalions: • Trophy Finga

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Sludgeraker Beast is armed with Grasping Talons, a Noisome Bite and a Thrashing Tail. The Venom-encrusted Weapons battle trait applies to attacks made with a Sludgeraker Beast’s Grasping Talons and Noisome Bite even though it is a mount.

## Poisons And Elixirs

_The underbelly of a Sludgeraker Beast is coated in rotting detritus, encrusted marsh-slime and the beast’s own excretions - a highly virulent mixture which is used by nearby Kruleboyz to coat their weapons._

Sludgeraker Venom: Add 1 to the number of mortal wounds caused by the Venom-encrusted Weapons battle trait if the unmodified hit roll was 6 and the attacking unit is wholly within 12" of any friendly units with this ability.Designer’s Note: If a unit is affected by this ability and has been given a poison from the Swampcalla Shaman’s Poisons and Elixirs ability, this ability does not affect unmodified hit rolls of 5 and only affects unmodified hit rolls of 6.

## Expert Snatch And Grab

_Skumdrekk and Sloppklaw work together with terrifying precision to seize a victim, disarm them and stuff them into a waiting cage._

Expert Snatch and Grab: Once per battle, at the end of the combat phase, you can pick 1 enemy model that has a Wounds characteristic of 7 or less, does not have a mount and is within 3" of this unit, and roll 2D6. If the roll is equal to or greater than that enemy model’s Wounds characteristic, it is slain.
