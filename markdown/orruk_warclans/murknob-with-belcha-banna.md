# Murknob with Belcha-banna

_Murknobs are champion warriors amongst the Kruleboyz, and they revel in taking the heads of their adversaries - honestly or otherwise. They alone are granted the honour of carrying the Belcha-bannas into battle, each a foul relic with all manner of strange powers._

## Power Of Kragnos

_Each Belcha-banna is said to be linked to the mighty Kragnos. Certainly, the terrible roars that emanate from these icons are capable of chasing away even the power of the arcane._

Power of Kragnos: When a friendly KRULEBOYZ ORRUK unit wholly within 12" of this unit is affected by a spell or the abilities of an endless spell, you can roll a dice. On a 5+, ignore the effect of that spell or the effects of that endless spell’s abilities on that unit.

## Breath Of The Mire-Drakes

_Belcha-bannas are typically built around the severed tongue of a mire-drake, creatures so vile that even after death, their remains belch forth clouds of soul-shrivelling gas._

Breath of the Mire-drakes: At the start of the combat phase, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 3" of this unit. On a 1, nothing happens. On a 2-5, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound. On a 6, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.
