# Gobsprakk, the Mouth of Mork

_Canniest and gnarliest of all Swampcalla Shamans, Gobsprakk is heralded by the Kruleboyz as the Prophet of Mork. Bedecked in the gruesome remains of rival wizards, he has a flair for wreaking arcane devastation, and can rely on his hideous steed Killabeak to shred the enemy when the fighting gets up close and personal._

_Gobsprakk, the Mouth of Mork, is armed with a Bogbark Staff._

## Wizard

WIZARD: This unit can attempt to cast 2 spells in your hero phase and attempt to unbind 2 spells in the enemy hero phase. If this unit is part of an Orruk Warclans army, it knows all of the spells from the Lore of the Swamp in addition to the other spells it knows.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Corpse-rippa Vulcha is armed with a Beak and Flesh-tearing Talons, and a Stinger. The Venom-encrusted Weapons battle trait applies to attacks made with a Corpserippa Vulcha’s Beak and Flesh-tearing Talons and its Stinger even though it is a mount.

## Companion

COMPANION: This unit is accompanied by the grot Rinklefinga, who is armed with a Back-up Stabba.

## Fly

FLY: This unit can fly.

## Glyphic Banners

_The leathery banners upon Gobsprakk’s trophy rack have a potent spiritual connection to Kragnos, and the magical glyphs marked upon them channel a measure of the Drogrukh god’s immortal energies._

This model has a ward of 6+.

## Mork Sez No!

_Gobsprakk takes particular pride in hunting down enemy wizards to add their grisly remains to his trophy rack. As they foolishly attempt to weave their magics, he summons tapewyrm sguigs into their guts and fills their minds with so much Waaagh! energy that they sometimes explode!_

Each time this unit unbinds a spell, the caster suffers D3 mortal wounds. If the spell was unbound with an unbinding roll of 10+, the caster suffers D6 mortal wounds instead.

## Mouth Of Mork

_Gobsprakk speaks words he claims come to him directly from Mork - gibbering, rumbling foretellings that thunder across the battlefield and give warning to the assembled Kruleboyz of the enemy’s intentions._

Mouth of Mork: If this unit issues the Redeploy command to a KRULEBOYZ unit, you can re-roll the dice that determines the distance the unit that receives the command can move.If this unit issues the Unleash Hell command to a KRULEBOYZ unit, you do not have to subtract 1 from the hit rolls for the attacks made by the unit that receives the command.

## Screamin’ Mandrakk

_Rinklefinga carries with him a hideous root that emits a shrill cry when squeezed or pinched. The awful sound wreaks havoc on the concentration of enemy wizards who are trying to cast spells._

Once per battle, when this unit attempts to unbind a spell, you can say that it is using its Screamin’ Mandrakk. If you do so, the unbinding roll for that attempt is made with 3D6 instead of 2D6.

## Summon Boggy Mist

_Raising their hands with a guttural belch, the Swampcalla transmutes the ground into marshland. As they do so, thick and foul-smelling swamp mists smother the field, distracting enemies and aiding the Kruleboyz in a stealthy advance._

Summon Boggy Mist is a spell that has a casting value of 7. If successfully cast, until your next hero phase, add 1 to charge rolls for friendly KRULEBOYZ ORRUK units on the battlefield and subtract 1 from charge rolls for other units on the battlefield.
