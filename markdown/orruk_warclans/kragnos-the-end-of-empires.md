# Kragnos, the End of Empires

_A roaring, trampling god of earthquakes and wanton destruction, Kragnos is known as the End of Empires. In his gnarled hands, the Dread Mace can shatter the walls of cities even as the shield Tuskbreaker keeps him all but inviolate._

_Kragnos, the End of Empires, is armed with the Dread Mace, Tuskbreaker and Hooves of Wrack and Ruin._

## Warmaster

WARMASTER: This unit can be included in an Orruk Warclans, Gloomspite Gitz, Ogor Mawtribes or Sons of Behemat army. If it is, it is treated as a general even if it is not the model picked to be the army’s general. In addition, you can still use the army’s allegiance abilities even though this unit is not from the army’s faction; however, this unit does not benefit from them.

## Bellow Of Rage

_When wounded, Kragnos bellows at the top of his lungs, the sound waves bursting the eardrums of those nearby and rocking buildings at their foundations._

Bellow of Rage: At the end of any phase, if any wounds were allocated to this unit in that phase, roll a dice for each other unit and each defensible terrain feature within 6" of this unit. If the roll is equal to or greater than the Bellow of Rage value shown on this unit’s damage table, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds or that defensible terrain feature is demolished.

## The End Of Empires

_Where Kragnos rampages, the hordes of Destruction follow in his wake, bolstered by his presence and eager to share in the violence he metes out._

The End of Empires: If a friendly DESTRUCTION unit is wholly within 12" of this unit, you can attempt a charge with that unit if it is within 18" of an enemy unit instead of 12". In addition, when making a charge roll for a friendly DESTRUCTION unit wholly within 12" of this unit, roll 3D6 instead of 2D6.

## Avatar Of Destruction

_Kragnos is the embodiment of Ghur’s ferocious nature and no single strike can lay him low._

Avatar of Destruction: If the effect of a spell or ability would slay this model without any wounds or mortal wounds being caused by the spell or ability, this model suffers D6 mortal wounds instead of being slain.

## Mightiest Makes Rightiest

_Known as the End of Empires, the Living Earthquake and the Lord of Wreck and Ruin, the warlike spirit of Kragnos is matched by none._

For the purposes of contesting objectives, this unit counts as a number of models equal to the Mightiest Makes Rightiest value on its damage table.

## The Shield Inviolate

_Tuskbreaker makes Kragnos impervious to even the most potent magical hexes and bolts._

This unit has a ward of 6+. In addition, each time this unit is affected by a spell or the abilities of an endless spell, you can roll 3D6. If the roll is greater than the casting value of that spell or the spell used to summon that endless spell, ignore the effect of that spell or the effects of that endless spell’s abilities on this unit.
