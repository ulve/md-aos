# Da Snorter’s Kop Rukk

_The Wurrgog Prophet known as Da Snorter has become infamous across the wastes of central Thondia. This connection to the beast-spirits runs deep, as does the spiritual power bound into his warpaint. When Da Snorter leads the boyz of his Kop Rukk on a rampage, enemies are wise to take cover._
