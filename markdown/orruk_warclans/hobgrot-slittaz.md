# Hobgrot Slittaz

_Mobs of Hobgrot Slittaz have often been witnessed accompanying the Kruleboy orruks to war. These malicious little brutes delight in eviscerating the foe with their slitta-knives and employing explosive devices pilfered from their duardin paymasters to blow unlucky enemies apart._

## Stab ’Em Good!

_Hobgrot Slittaz are surprisingly dexterous and are able to wield two weapons extremely effectively (for grots)._

If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with Slitta-knives is 6, that attack scores 2 hits on the target instead of 1. Make a wound and save roll for each hit.
