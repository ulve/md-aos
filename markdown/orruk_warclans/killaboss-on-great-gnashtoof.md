# Killaboss on Great Gnashtoof

_Particularly storied Killabosses are able to procure all manner of terrifying, swamp-dwelling mounts from the Beastbreakaz to show off their status. Great Gnashtoofs are one such monster, huge and vicious hounds whose swiftness is matched only by their ferocity._

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Great Gnashtoof attacks with its Bone-crushing Fangs.

## All Part Of Da Plan

_Kruleboyz tend to be very impressed by a Killaboss’s kunnin’ feats - so long as the boss has a plan, they are willing to face down even the most unlikely odds._

All Part of Da Plan: If a friendly KRULEBOYZ unit fails a battleshock test within 3" of any friendly units with this ability, only 1 model from that unit will flee.

## Savage Hound

_Great Gnashtoofs are canine monsters bred for feral savagery. When the stench of blood is in the air, they find the urge to bound forward and pounce nearly irresistible - this suits their Killaboss riders just fine, given the terror it inspires in the foe._

Add 1 to hit rolls for attacks made by this unit if this unit made a charge move in the same turn.
