# Killaboss on Corpse-rippa Vulcha

_The Killaboss rules through strength as well as cunning, for he has an expert eye for picking out an enemy’s weak spot and driving a blade into it. In battle, those who ride the immense raptor-like creatures known as Corpse-rippa Vulchas dive out of the mists without warning, striking from nowhere to gut the enemy force._

## All Part Of Da Plan

_Kruleboyz tend to be very impressed by a Killaboss’s kunnin’ feats - so long as the boss has a plan, they are willing to face down even the most unlikely odds._

All Part of Da Plan: If a friendly KRULEBOYZ unit fails a battleshock test within 3" of any friendly units with this ability, only 1 model in that unit will flee.

## Commanding View

_From their position high above the battlefield, a Killaboss riding a Corpse-rippa Vulcha can keep a careful eye on the battle as it unfolds, allowing them to issue exactly the right command wherever or whenever it is needed._

You can use the same command ability more than once in the same phase if you pick this unit to issue the command (this unit still cannot issue more than 1 command in the same phase and a unit still cannot receive more than 1 command in the same phase).
