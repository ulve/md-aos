# Megaboss on Maw-krusha

_A charging Maw-krusha is a terrifying force of destruction, capable of pulverising entire formations single-handedly. The Megabosses that ride these beasts are amongst the most deadly of their kind, inspiring their lads through feats of excessive brutality._

_A Megaboss on Maw-krusha is armed with 1 of the following weapon options: Boss Gore-hacka and Choppa; or Boss Choppa and Rip-toof Fist._

## Shield

SHIELD: If this unit is armed with a Boss Choppa and Rip-toofFist, it has a Save characteristic of 3+ instead of 4+.

## Mount

MOUNT: This unit’s Maw-krusha is armed with an Innard-bursting Roar and its Mighty Fists and Tail.

## Fly

FLY: This unit can fly.

## Destructive Bulk

_A Maw-krusha is an unstoppable avalanche of ill-tempered muscle that turns all in its path into pulverised meat._

If you carry out a Stomp monstrous rampage with this unit and the enemy unit you picked suffers any mortal wounds, that enemy unit suffers an additional number of mortal wounds equal to the Destructive Bulk value on this unit’s damage table. After all models slain by those mortal wounds have been removed from play, if there are no enemy models within 3” of this unit, you can move this unit D6" and then you can carry out another Stomp monstrous rampage with this unit even though you have already carried out the Stomp monstrous rampage in that phase.

## Skull-Shaking Bellow

_The roared commands issued by a Megaboss riding a Maw-krusha reach far and wide, inspiring Ironjawz under their command to fight all the harder._

Skull-shaking Bellow: This unit can issue the same command up to 3 times in the same phase. If it does so, each command must be received by a friendly IRONJAWZ unit. No command point is spent the second and third times this unit issues that command in that phase.

## Strength From Victory

_The more fights a Megaboss wins, the stronger he becomes._

At the end of the combat phase, if any models were slain by a wound caused by an attack made by this unit in that combat phase, add 1 to this unit’s Wounds characteristic and add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of this unit’s melee weapons, excluding those of its mount.
