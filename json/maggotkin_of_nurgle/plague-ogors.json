 "Title": "Plague Ogors",
 "Legend": "Plague Ogors are vile and malformed hulks whose natural resilience is augmented by the pox-ridden mutations and favours of their foul patron. They shamble into battle, battering their way through the enemy’s ranks whilst spreading Nurgle’s filthsome gifts.",

   "Name": "Insatiably Famished",
   "Fluff": "With all manner of daemonic parasites crawling through their guts, Plague Ogors are utterly incapable of satisfying their ravenous hunger, no matter how quickly they wolf down the meat of their prey; as a result, their charges into battle often culminate in acts of extreme gluttony.",

   "Fluff": "Its flesh covered in sores that seep a poisonous ooze, even a touch from a Plague Ogor can riddle an enemy’s body with deadly diseases that can kill in minutes.",
   "Rule": "At the end of the combat phase, you can roll 1 dice for each enemy unit within 3\" of this unit. On a 5+, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds."
