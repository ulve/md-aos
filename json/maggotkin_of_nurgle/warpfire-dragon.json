 "Title": "Warpfire Dragon",
 "Legend": "Twisted and malignant, these dragons are ruinous creatures that spit gouts of mutating warpfire. Should one of these spite-filled beasts be slain, its body will erupt in a nova of anarchic energy, reducing its foes to mounds of malformed flesh.",

   "Fluff": "Even in their last moments, these creatures are deadly, and those arrogant enough to believe they have won victory are soon bloodily corrected.",
   "Rule": "ABILITIES If this model is slain, before it is removed from play, roll a dice for each unit within 3\" of this model. On a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. This model is then removed from play."

   "Fluff": "These scintillating flames cause flesh and bone to undergo rapid and grotesque mutations, reshaping those touched into utterly grotesque configurations of their former selves.",
   "Rule": "Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with this modelâ€™s Warpfire. Instead roll a dice. On a 1, nothing happens. On a 2-5, the target unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. On a 6, the target unit suffers D6 mortal wounds."
