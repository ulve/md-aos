   "Fluff": "The venom that drips from a Troglodon’s jaws is extremely toxic and highly corrosive.",
   "Rule": "If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this unit’s Noxious Spittle or Venomous Jaws is 6, that attack causes a number of mortal wounds to the target equal to the weapon’s Damage characteristic and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound roll or save roll)."

  {
   "Name": "Primordial Mire",
   "Fluff": "Wielding reality-shifting powers that are typically the province of the slann, an Oracle transmutes a portion of the battlefield into primal swampland, the favoured hunting ground of their Troglodon mounts.",
   "Rule": "Primordial Mire is a spell that has a casting value of 7 and a range of 12\". If successfully cast, pick 1 objective or terrain feature within range and visible to the caster. Until your next hero phase, units within 3\" of that objective or terrain feature cannot run or retreat and must halve the result of any charge rolls. This spell has no effect on SKINK units and units that can fly."
