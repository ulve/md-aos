   "Name": "Skink Guidance",
   "Fluff": "The physical strength of these brutish creatures comes at the cost of their diminished intellect, and so Kroxigor rely on nearby skinks to direct them in battle.",

   "Name": "Heavy-Scaled Skin",

   "Name": "Spawn Of Sotek",
   "Fluff": "Should any of the Serpent God’s devoted skink acolytes come to harm, Kroxigor Warspawned are overcome with a terrifying rage.",

  {
   "Name": "Vice-Like Jaws",
   "Fluff": "With rows of serrated iron-sharp fangs, few can survive the powerful bite of a Kroxigor.",
   "Rule": "Vice-like Jaws: Each time this unit fights, after all of its attacks have been resolved, pick 1 enemy unit within 1\" of this unit and roll 3 dice for each model in this unit within 1\" of that unit. These dice rolls are referred to as bite rolls. For each bite roll of 6+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound."
