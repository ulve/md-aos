  {
   "Name": "Arcane Glyphs",
   "Fluff": "Dread Saurians go to war clad in techno-arcane glyph-plates through which a slann can channel power to ward off enemy sorceries.",
   "Rule": "ABILITIES Each time this model is affected by a spell or the ability of an endless spell, you can roll a dice. If you do so, on a 6+, ignore the effects of that spell or the ability of that endless spell on this model. Add 2 to the roll if this model is within 12\" of a friendly SLANN."

   "Fluff": "A Dread Saurianâ€™s sheer scaled mass is a potent weapon in its own right.",
   "Rule": "After this model makes a charge move, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 1\" of this model. On a 2+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds if it is a MONSTER or D6 mortal wounds if it is not a MONSTER."

   "Name": "Death Throes",
   "Fluff": "Even a mortally wounded Dread Saurian cannot be discounted, for it will lash out violently before meeting its end.",

   "Fluff": "This horrific monstrosity strikes fear deep into the hearts of its enemies.",
   "Rule": "Subtract 1 from the Bravery characteristic of enemy units if they are within 3\" of any friendly units with this ability."
