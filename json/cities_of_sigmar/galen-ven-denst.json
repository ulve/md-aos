   "Fluff": "Inscribed with the holy writ of Sigmar and inlaid with nullstone and silver, the weapons of the Ven Densts are anathema to spellcasters and their works, banishing all forms of arcane energy in a flash.",
   "Rule": "Weapons of Banishment:  Double the Damage characteristic of an attack made with this modelâ€™s weapons if the target of that attack is a WIZARD or DAEMON. In addition, when this model fights or shoots, you can choose an endless spell to be the target of any of its attacks. If you do so, roll a dice to see if that attack scores a hit. If it does, do not make a wound or save roll. Instead, roll 2D6. If the roll is greater than the casting value of that endless spell, that endless spell is dispelled."
