 "Legend": "A Mistweaver Saih is a powerful enchantress. Drifting amidst a swirling, sorcerous haze, she flickers in and out of sight at will, sowing confusion and paranoia amongst those who have drawn her ire. Amidst the carnage the aelven enchantress remains disturbingly serene, the eye at the heart of a storm of illusory horror and bloodshed.",

   "Rule": "ABILITIES Once per turn, when this unit is picked as the target of an attack, you can say that the Mistweaver will shroud herself in glimmermist. If you do so, this unit’s Save characteristic is 1+ instead of 6+ until all of the attacking unit’s attacks have been resolved."

If the roll is greater than that enemy unit’s Bravery characteristic, it suffers D3 mortal wounds. If the roll is at least double that enemy unit’s Bravery characteristic, it suffers D6 mortal wounds instead."
