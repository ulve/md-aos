 "Legend": "A spine-chilling shadow against the sky, the Abhorrant Ghoul King and his Terrorgheist embody the eternal darkness of undeath. From the gaping maw of the massive bat-beast, a shrill scream cuts across the battlefield, turning blood to ice.",

   "Fluff": "The terrifying shriek of a Terrorgheist is enough to stop a warrior’s heart.",
   "Rule": "ABILITIES Do not use the attack sequence for an attack made with this model’s Death Shriek. Instead roll a dice and add the Death Shriek value shown on this model’s damage table. If the total is higher than the target unit’s Bravery characteristic, the target unit suffers a number of mortal wounds equal to the difference between its Bravery characteristic and the total."

   "Fluff": "This horrific creature bites a great chunk out of its prey, or even swallows it whole.",
   "Rule": "If the unmodified hit roll for an attack made with this model’s Fanged Maw is 6, that attack inflicts 6 mortal wounds on the target unit and the attack sequence ends (do not make a wound or save roll)."

   "Name": "Unholy Vitality",
   "Fluff": "The Abhorrant Ghoul King infuses the crooked bodies of his minions with dark magic, making it nigh impossible for their enemies to stop their ravenous onslaught.",
   "Rule": "Unholy Vitality has a casting value of 6. If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly FLESH-EATER COURTS unit wholly within 24\" of the caster and visible to them. Until your next hero phase, roll a dice each time you allocate a wound or mortal wound to that unit. On a 5+ that wound or mortal wound is negated."

   "Fluff": "With a snarled command, the Ghoul King calls forth his most elite retainers.",
   "Rule": "COMMAND ABILITIES You can use this command ability at the end of your movement phase. If you do so, pick 1 friendly model that has this command ability and has not used it before in the battle. That model summons 1 unit of up to 3 KNIGHTS to the battlefield. The summoned unit is added to your army, and must be set up wholly within 6\" of the edge of the battlefield and more than 9\" from any enemy units."
