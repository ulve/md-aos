   "Fluff": "A Maw-krusha is an unstoppable avalanche of ill-tempered muscle that turns all in its path into pulverised meat.",
   "Rule": "If you carry out a Stomp monstrous rampage with this unit and the enemy unit you picked suffers any mortal wounds, that enemy unit suffers an additional number of mortal wounds equal to the Destructive Bulk value on this unit’s damage table. After all models slain by those mortal wounds have been removed from play, if there are no enemy models within 3\" of this unit, you can move this unit D6\" and then you can carry out another Stomp monstrous rampage with this unit even though you have already carried out the Stomp monstrous rampage in that phase."

   "Name": "Voice Of Gork",
   "Fluff": "Gordrakk’s bellow carries the elemental force of his god and inspires his forces to surge into the enemy, hacking, bludgeoning and stomping with furious abandon.",
   "Rule": "Voice of Gork: This unit can issue the same command up to 3 times in the same phase. If it does so, no command point is spent the second and third times this unit issues that command in that phase."
  },
  {
   "Name": "Strength From Victory",
   "Fluff": "The more fights a Megaboss wins, the stronger he becomes.",
   "Rule": "At the end of the combat phase, if any models were slain by a wound caused by an attack made by this unit in that combat phase, add 1 to this unit’s Wounds characteristic and add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of this unit’s melee weapons, excluding those of its mount."
