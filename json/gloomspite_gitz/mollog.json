   "Rule": "COMPANIONS: Mollog is accompanied by a Bat Squig, Spiteshroom and Stalagsquig. Mollog and his companions are treated as a single model that uses the characteristics above. His companions must remain within 1\" of him.Before you allocate a wound or mortal wound to this unit, or instead of making a ward roll for a wound or mortal wound that would be allocated to this unit, you can choose to remove 1 of its companions. If you do so, that wound or mortal wound is negated."

   "Name": "Spiteshroom",
   "Fluff": "The incessant high- pitched shrieking and shrill, idiot ditties of this weird creature can distract even the most veteran warrior.",
   "Rule": "At the start of the combat phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit within 3\" of this unit and roll a dice. On a 5+, subtract 1 from hit rolls for attacks made by that unit in that phase. This ability cannot be used if the Spiteshroom companion has been removed."
