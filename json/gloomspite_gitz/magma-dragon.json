 "Title": "Magma Dragon",
 "Legend": "These primordial beasts are among the most malevolent of dragon kind. Their gullet burns with the intensity of a raging volcano, and when roused to wrath they incinerate their foes with jets of flame, or else tear them to shreds with their enormous claws and fangs.",

   "Fluff": "The lifeblood that flows through Magma Dragons is molten rock. To spill it is akin to standing beside a volcanic eruption.",
   "Rule": "Roll a dice each time a wound or mortal wound that was caused by a melee weapon is allocated to this model. On a 4+, the attacking unit suffers 1 mortal wound. On a 6, the attacking unit suffers D3 mortal wounds instead."
