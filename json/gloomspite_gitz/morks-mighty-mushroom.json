 "Title": "Mork’s Mighty Mushroom",
 "Legend": "Mork’s Mighty Mushroom begins as a single spore plucked from between the caster’s filthy toes. By the time it is flung at the foe, it has swollen into a fully grown mushroom, and within moments it blooms into something huge and unutterably foul.",

 "Intro": "SUMMONING: This endless spell is summoned with a spell that has a casting value of 6 and a range of 6D6\". If successfully cast, set up this endless spell wholly within range and visible to the caster, and more than 1\" from all models, other endless spells and invocations. Only GLOOMSPITE GITZ WIZARDS can attempt to summon this endless spell.",
 "Rules": [
  {
   "Name": "Mutating Spores",
   "Fluff": "Grots know to steer clear of even the smallest Skullshrooms, as their spores have a terrifying and immediate effect upon those who come into contact with them. When Mork’s Mighty Mushroom erupts onto the battlefield, it belches inescapable clouds of these horrible motes that cause smaller Skullshrooms to violently burst forth from everything they touch - a process that has particularly messy results upon living things.",
   "Rule": "At the start of the shooting phase, roll a number of dice for each unit within 8\" of this endless spell equal to the number of models in that unit that are within 8\" of this endless spell. For each 5+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound."
