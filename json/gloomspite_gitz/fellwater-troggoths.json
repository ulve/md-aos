   "Rule": "If any wounds caused by this unit’s Noxious Vomit are allocated to an enemy unit and not negated, that enemy unit is drenched in vomit until the start of your next hero phase. While a unit is drenched in vomit, subtract 1 from save rolls for attacks that target that unit, and ignore positive modifiers to save rolls for attacks that target that unit. A unit cannot be drenched in vomit more than once at the same time."
