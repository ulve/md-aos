   "Rule": "After this unit is set up on the battlefield for the first time, roll a dice for each enemy unit within 10\" of this unit. On a 3+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. In addition, you can re-roll charge rolls for this unit if it was set up on the battlefield in the same turn."

Subtract 1 from the roll if this unit only has 2 models. Subtract 2 from the roll if this unit only has 1 model. For each 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound."
