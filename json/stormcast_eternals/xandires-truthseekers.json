   "Name": "Blazing Arrows",
   "Fluff": "Luxa Stormrider’s rune-etched arrows glow as if they had a molten core.",

   "Rule": "After an enemy unit finishes a charge move within 3\" of Dhoraz Giant-fell, roll a dice. On a 3+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds. If that unit has a mount or is a MONSTER, it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead of D3."
