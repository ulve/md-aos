   "Fluff": "When a Knight-Judicator calls upon the God-King to unleash his wrath, the cursed skies are split by a column of purifying light that slams into the enemy.",
   "Rule": "Gaze of Sigmar: Once per battle, in your shooting phase, you can say that this unit will draw the gaze of Sigmar instead of attacking with its missile weapons. If you do so, pick 1 point on the battlefield within 30\" of this unit and visible to it. Roll a dice for each enemy unit within 6\" of that point. On a 4+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds."
